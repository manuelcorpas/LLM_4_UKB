About 500,000 participants were included in the UK Biobank. Of 498,103 participants included (54% of whom were women) aged 37-73 years, 8532 died during a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR 4.33-5.22) Self-reported health (C-index including age 0.74 [95% CI 0.73-0.75]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men and a previous cancer diagnosis (0.73 [0.72-0,74] for women) When excluding individuals with major diseases or disorders (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355 043), measures of smoking habits were

UK Biobank is the largest retinal data repository in a prospective population-based cohort. Images were drawn from those of 68,554 participants who underwent retinal imaging at recruitment. Increasing age was associated with a reduced proportion of images that could be processed.

Common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan. The effects are strongly sex and age dependent, with APOE &#603;4 differentially influencing maternal lifespan. Rare homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.3-3.7 years shorter lives.

Verbal reasoning performance is an indicator of the ability to think constructively in everyday life. This study aimed to determine the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning when controlling for age, gender, and education.

Low fat-free mass (FFM) is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in elderly and patient populations. FFM and FFMI were significantly associated with BMI and decreased with age. Because these reference values are BMI specific, they are of broad interest for overweight and obese populations.

A one kilogram increase in birthweight was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank participants. Paternal diabetes was associated. with lower birthweight (45 g lower; 95% CI: 36, 54; P = 2 Ã— 10(-23) relative to individuals with no parental diabetes. Maternal diabetes is associated with higher birthweight. Findings with paternal diabetes are consistent with a role for the same genetic factors influencing foetal growth.

In this cross-sectional analysis of the UK Biobank cohort, a history of fracture was associated with increased risk of current widespread chronic pain. Individuals with prior fracture were significantly more likely to report CWBP than those without.

Several studies have shown that smoking may confer a greater excess risk for chronic diseases in women compared with men. The reasons for this excess risk of smoking in women are unclear, yet sex differences in smoking habits may play a role. In the oldest cohort, born 1935-1939, women started smoking 1.9 years (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1) later than did men.

Cross-sectional study using baseline data from the unique UK Biobank resource. Participants with and without RA were compared in terms of sociodemographic, lifestyle and other disease-related risk factors. Prevalence was significantly higher among female, South Asian and socioeconomically deprived participants.

Study examines relationship with self-reported health (SRH) and happiness. Compared with obese men, obese women are less likely to report poor health, but more likely to feel unhappy.

Previous studies on the association between adiposity and mood disorder have produced contradictory results. Few have used measurements other than body mass index (BMI) We examined association between probable major depression and several measurements of adiposity: BMI, waist circumference and waist-hip-ratio.

The UK Biobank offers cross-sectional epidemiological data collected on >500,000 individuals in the UK between 40 and 70 years of age. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of functional hearing loss and hearing aid usage on visuospatial memory function. Age also showed strong main effects for both memory tasks.

Visuospatial working memory (VSWM) has been shown to be poorer in individuals with poorer hearing but better in profoundly deaf individuals. Using data from the UK Biobank resource, a large observational study, we showed that variance in card-pair matching was large among profoundly deaf participants.

Study investigated differences in cognitive performance between middle-aged adults with and without a lifetime history of mood disorder features. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort.

Low birth weight has been inconsistently associated with risk of developing affective disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) To date, studies investigating possible associations between birth weight and bipolar disorder (BD) have not been conducted in large cohorts. Very low/low birth weight were associated with higher neuroticism scores.

UK Biobank is a landmark cohort of over 500,000 participants. This is the first study to systematically assess the prevalence and validity of proposed criteria for probable mood disorders.

Cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease [CAD] and diabetes) are known to associate with poorer cognitive ability. There are limited data on whether having more than one of these conditions is associated with additive effects. We examined cognitive test scores in domains of reasoning, information processing speed and memory.

There was a weak correlation (r = 0.24) between energy from sugar and fat. The proportion of energy from fat in the diet, but not sugar, is higher among overweight/obese individuals. Focusing public health messages on sugar may mislead on the need to reduce fat and overall energy consumption.

UK Biobank includes 502,649 middle- and older-aged adults. Majority of participants completed tests of cognitive functioning. A sub-group of N = 20,346 participants repeated most of the assessment.

Insufficient physical activity is a determinant of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Active travel to work has declined in high-income countries in recent decades. We aimed to determine which characteristics predicted switching to or from active commuting.

Physical inactivity is a leading cause of obesity and premature mortality. We aimed to examine the relation between active commuting and obesity in mid-life using objectively measured anthropometric data from UK Biobank.

Study looked at 212,039 men aged 40-69 years in UK Biobank. A total of 62,022 (29%) men reported they had ever had a PSA test. A wide range of factors was associated with a higher likelihood of PSA testing. These included age, height, education level, family history of prostate cancer.

Study examined associations of sleep duration and morning-evening type with sociodemographic and cardiometabolic disease in adults participating in the UK Biobank study. Black ethnicity emerged as most strongly associated with sleep behavior.

Sleep duration has been implicated in the etiology of obesity but less is known about the association between sleep and other behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to examine associations among sleep duration, chronotype, and physical activity, screen-based sedentary behavior, tobacco use, and dietary intake.

Sleep duration and morningness/eveningness (circadian preference) have separately been associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Interactive effects are plausible, resulting from combinations of sleep homeostatic and circadian influences. These have not been examined in a population sample.

Of the many common variants now associated with body mass index, those in an intron of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene have the largest effect. We jointly examine the evidence for interactions between FTO (rs1421085) and various lifestyle and environmental factors.

Recent epidemiological data suggest the relation between hearing difficulty and depression is more evident in younger and middle-aged populations than in older adults. There are also suggestions that the relation may be more apparent in specific subgroups. Findings suggest that audiological services should facilitate psychosocial counselling.

Loci associated with insomnia symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness. Findings based on genome-wide association analyses in the UK Biobank cohort.

Alcohol consumption has been linked to over 200 diseases and is responsible for over 5% of the global disease burden. Well-known genetic variants in alcohol metabolizing genes, for example, ALDH2 and ADH1B, are strongly associated with alcohol consumption. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of self-reported alcohol consumption in 112 117 individuals in the UK Biobank.

Birth weight (BW) has been shown to be influenced by both fetal and maternal factors. BW is reproducibly associated with future risk of adult metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease1.

People's differences in cognitive functions are partly heritable and are associated with important life outcomes. Previous genome-wide association studies of cognitive functions have found evidence for polygenic effects yet, to date, there are few replicated genetic associations. Here we use data from the UK Biobank sample to investigate the genetic contributions to variation in tests of three cognitive functions and in educational attainment.

 Differences in general cognitive function have been shown to be partly heritable and to show genetic correlations with several psychiatric and physical disease states. Few single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have demonstrated genome-wide significance, hampering efforts aimed at determining which genetic variants are most important for cognitive function.

The identification of rare coding or splice site variants remains the most straightforward strategy to link genes with human phenotypes. We analyzed the association between 137,086 rare variants and 15 hematological traits in up to 308,572 participants. We found 56 such rare variants at P<5x10-8, including 31 that are associated with a blood-cell phenotype for the first time.

The lack of mechanistic explanations for many genotype-phenotype associations identified by GWAS precludes thorough assessment of their impact on human health. We conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping analysis in erythroblasts and found erythroid-specific eQTLs for ATP2B4.

The UK Biobank is a unique resource for biomedical research. We aimed to examine the effect of neurodevelopmental copy number variants (CNVs) on the cognitive performance of participants. Carriers of schizophrenia-associated CNVs and of the group of 41 other neuro developmental CNVs had impaired performance on cognitive tests. They also had lower educational and occupational attainment.

Cognitive impairment was least common in major depression. Prevalence in mania/bipolar was similar to that in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Estimated population attributable prevalence of cognitive impairment was higher for major depression than for all other disorders.

Cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common causes of morbidity and mortality. We measured raw and adjusted rates of CVD for the following groups: individuals with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung and trachea cancer, uterus cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, or no recorded diagnosed cancer.

The personality trait of neuroticism has also been associated with elevated rates of death in some studies. We tested the possibility that it is the neuroticism trait itself, rather than the distress state, that is generating an increased risk of mortality. Higher neuroticism was weakly associated with total mortality.

Five thousand sixty-five UK Biobank participants underwent CMR using steady-state free precession imaging at 1.5 Tesla. With advancing age, LV volumes were mostly smaller in both sexes. LV ejection fraction was significantly greater in females compared to males.

The T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; c.-211G>T) results in longer menstrual cycles and later menopause. While having detrimental effects on fertility, it is protective against endometriosis.

Being part of a multiple birth was strongly associated with early menopause (odds ratio = 1.42, confidence interval: 1.11, 1.82, P = 8.0 Ã— 10-9) Earlier age at menarche and earlier year of birth were also associated with EM.

The minimum prevalence of any VRIA was 17.6% and 8.1% in the eyes with and without visual impairment, respectively. epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction were the most common VRIA. The degree of visual impairment was typically milder with these than with otherVRIA.

UK Biobank participants aged 40-69 had mild visual impairment or worse in one or both eyes. Increasing deprivation, age and ethnicity were independently associated with both monocular and binocular visual impairment. No primary diagnosis for the recorded level of visual impairment could be identified for 49.8% of eyes.

There is an international trend towards recommending medication to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a population approach with a polypill including a statin.

Sex differences in adiposity storage may explain these findings. Body mass index and waist circumference were 1.94 (95% CI 1.82 to 2.07) and 4.84 (4.53 to 5.16) higher in women than in men, respectively. In type I diabetes, body size differed to a similar extent in women as in men.

Cross-sectional analysis of 502 664 individuals from the UK Biobank was conducted. Age at menarche was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI) Corresponding associations for other markers of general or abdominal adiposity were similar to those for BMI.

Biological evidence suggests that ethno-racial differences in morning-evening type are possible, whereby Blacks may be more likely to be morning type compared to Whites. However, population-level evidence of ethna-racial difference is limited. In an earlier study, we reported that morning type was more prevalent in Blacks compared to White in the UK Biobank cohort.

UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort comprising 502,637 men and women aged 40 to 69 years at recruitment. Of that number, 33,437 participants reported taking calcium supplements; 19,089 vitamin D; and 10,007 both. In crude and adjusted analyses, there were no associations between use of calcium supplements and risk of incident hospital admission with either IHD, or subsequent death.

Previous studies of the number of offspring and cardiovascular disease (CVD) report conflicting findings. We re-examined this association in both sexes to clarify the role of the cardiometabolic changes that women experience during pregnancy versus shared lifestyle characteristics.

Chronic pain has a strong association with major depressive disorder (MDD) There is a relative paucity of studies on the association between chronic multisite pain and bipolar disorder (BD) Such studies are required to help elucidate the complex biological and psychological overlap between pain and mood disorders.

UK Biobank recruited 263 450 participants (106 674 (52%) women; mean age 52.6), recruited from 22 sites across the UK. The exposure variable was the mode of transport used (walking, cycling, mixed mode  v  non-active (car or public transport) to commute to and from work on a typical day. Main outcome measures  Incident (fatal and non-fatal) CVD and cancer, and deaths from CVD, cancer, or any causes.

The CCL3L1-CCR5 signaling axis is important in a number of inflammatory responses, including macrophage function and T-cell-dependent immune responses. Small molecule CCR5 antagonists exist, including the approved antiretroviral drug maraviroc, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are in development.

Heart rate response to exercise provides useful information about the autonomic function. Its reproducibility over a long period of time, a critical requirement for using it as a clinical biomarker, is undetermined.

 increased bone mineral density is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the relationship with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is less clear. We identified 235 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at p  -8 with estimated heel bone mineraldensity (eBMD) in 116,501 individuals from the UK Biobank study. For each eBMD-associated SNP, we extracted effect estimates from the largest available GWAS studies for T2D and CHD.

Male pattern baldness has been linked to adverse health outcomes such as prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease. We explored the genetic architecture of the trait using data from over 52,000 male participants of UK Biobank, aged 40-69 years. We identified over 250 independent genetic loci associated with severe hair loss.

Overall prevalence of facial pain (FP) was 1.9% (women 2.4%, men 1.2%) of which 48% was chronic. Highest prevalence was found in the 51 - 55 age group and lowest in the 66 - 73 age group. Prevalence of FP significantly associated with all measures of social class with the most deprived and on lowest income showing the highest prevalence.

The selective pressures that shape clonal evolution in healthy individuals are largely unknown. Here we investigate 8,342 mosaic chromosomal alterations that we uncovered in blood-derived DNA from 151,202 UK Biobank participants. At three such loci we identified a likely causal variant that acted with high penetrance (5-50%)

Community cohort participants (UK Biobank n = 502 637) aged 37-73 years were recruited between 2006 and 2010. Self-reported LTCs (n = 42) identified in people with AF at baseline. All-cause mortality was available for a median follow-up of 7 years (interquartile range 76-93 months) Co-morbid heart failure was associated with higher risk of mortality.

Even small reductions in risk factors helped to reduce frailty, as well as dementia, chronic pain, and other disabling conditions of old age. Optimizing cardiovascular disease risk factors may substantially reduce the burden of morbidity in later life.

Chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disorders) were associated with a 14% increase in the mean arterial stiffness. The findings support the use of a stiffness index as means to stratify people with inflammatory disorders according to potential risk for future CVD events.

 GWAS confirmed 14 previously reported loci for migraine and identified 14 new loci. Headache and other psychological traits (such as neuroticism, depression, etc) share common genetic components.

Cognitive functioning was compared between persons with and without obstructive lung disease (OLD) The relationship between impairment in lung function and cognitive impairment was assessed among persons with OLD.

Study looked at 100 000 community-dwelling, 39-70 year-old volunteers. Data support an association between functional hearing and depression. The association was not alleviated by hearing-aid usage, but was partially confounded by other physical health problems.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent and a significant source of disability. Its relationship with major depressive disorder (MDD) is of particular importance. We sought to test the contribution of genetic factors and shared and unique environment to risk of chronic pain and its correlation with MDD in Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study.

Higher body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease; however, the underlying causal associations remain unclear. The present study used UK Biobank data to report causal estimates of the association between BMI and disease outcomes and traits, such as pulse rate.

Data were available for more than 550,000 individuals and 51,623 cases of type 2 diabetes. PCSK9 variants associated with lower LDL cholesterol were also associated with circulating higher fasting glucose concentration, bodyweight, and waist-to-hip ratio.

Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) relay sensory information to the brain, giving rise to the perception of pain. Here, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a collection of human DRGs. DRG eQ TLs were enriched within untranslated regions of coding genes of low abundance.

We have called CNVs in the full UK Biobank. 488,423 individual CEL files were downloaded in 2016 and 2017. They were analysed with Affymetrix Powertools, followed by PennCNV.

Alcohol use is correlated within spouse-pairs, but it is difficult to disentangle effects of alcohol consumption on mate-selection from social factors or the shared spousal environment. We hypothesised that genetic variants related to alcohol consumption may, via their effect on alcohol behaviour, influence mate selection. We find strong evidence that an individual's self-reported alcohol consumption and their genotype at rs1229984, a missense variant in ADH1B, are associated with their partner's alcohol use.

 intelligence and education are phenotypically and genetically correlated, which makes it difficult to elucidate causal relationships. We used univariate and multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the total and direct effects of intelligence and educational attainment on mental and physical health, measures of socioeconomic position, and longevity. Higher intelligence had positive direct effects on income, alcohol consumption, and vigorous physical activity.

Red and processed meat may be risk factors for breast cancer due to their iron content, administration of oestrogens to cattle or mutagens created during cooking. We studied the associations in UK Biobank and then included the results in a meta-analysis of published cohort studies.

The potential of Mendelian randomization studies is rapidly expanding due to the growing power of genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses. We build upon and synthesize recent advances in the literature on instrumental variables (IVs) estimation that test and relax the exclusion restriction. We illustrate the practical use of PRMR by estimating the causal effect of tobacco exposure on body mass index.

Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using age at death of parents of middle-aged UK Biobank participants of European decent. Offspring of longer lived parents had more protective alleles for coronary artery disease, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

In human populations, assortative mating is almost univer&#173;sally positive. We find a correlation in genetic value among partners for a range of phenotypes. Our results imply that mate choice, combined with widespread pleiotropy, affects the genomic architecture of traits in humans.

This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Data, including genome-wide genotypes, were available for 105,421 European participants aged 40-69 years without kidney disease. Gout definitions and combinations of these definitions were identified from previous epidemiological studies.

Aging populations face diminishing quality of life due to increased disease and morbidity. These challenges call for longevity research to focus on understanding the pathways controlling healthspan. We identify 12 loci associated with healthspan at the whole-genome significance level.

Quantifying the effects of inbreeding is critical to characterizing the genetic architecture of complex traits. This study highlights the strengths and shortcomings of three SNP-based inbreeding measures commonly used to estimate inbreeding depression (ID) We find unique evidence of ID for handgrip strength, waist/hip ratio, and visual and auditory acuity.

A recent large-scale mega genome-wide association study identified, for the first time, genetic variants at 12 loci significantly associated with ADHD. We used a powerful polygenic approach to investigate the etiological overlap between ADHD and frequently co-occurring traits and disorders. We found no interaction effects between polygenic risk for ADHD and sex on any phenotypes.

Many common variants have been associated with hematological traits. Identification of causal genes and pathways has proven challenging. We performed a genome-wide association analysis in the UK Biobank and INTERVAL studies.

Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P)

Discretionary screen time is an important contributor to total sedentary behaviour. It is associated with increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) The aim of this study was to determine whether the associations of screen time with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were modified by levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength or physical activity.

Grip strength and diabetes are predictors of mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) But whether these risk factors interact to predispose to adverse health outcomes is unknown. Study determined the interactions between diabetes and grip strength and their association with health outcomes.

Genome-wide association studies of birth weight have focused on fetal genetics. We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight. Maternal SNPs at 10 loci were associated with offspring birth weight at P.

Being a morning person is a behavioural indicator of a person's underlying circadian rhythm. Using genome-wide data from 697,828 UK Biobank and 23andMe participants we increase the number of genetic loci associated with being a morningperson from 24 to 351.

Macular thickness was positively correlated with older age, female gender, greater myopia, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and white ethnicity. We report macular thickness data derived from SD OCT images collected as part of the UK Biobank (UKBB) study.

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-Bruch's membrane (BM) complex thickness as measured by spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) Study included people with no self-reported ocular disease, diabetes, or neurologic disorders. RPE-BM was significantly thinner with older age.

UK Biobank plans to acquire 100,000 cardiac MRI studies by 2020. Fully-automated left ventricular (LV) analysis was performed in the original acquisition. This was not designed for unsupervised incorporation into epidemiological studies.

Cardiovascular resonance (CMR) imaging is a standard imaging modality for assessing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of death globally. CMR enables accurate quantification of the cardiac chamber volume, ejection fraction and myocardial mass. For years, clinicians have been relying on manual approaches for CMR image analysis.

The framework reproduced significant reductions in circumferential strain in participants with diabetes, hypertensive participants, and participants with a previous heart attack. Typical processing time was approximately 260 frames (approximately 13 slices) per second on a GPU with 12 GB RAM compared with 6-8 minutes per slice for the manual analysis.

Little is known about the effect of cessation of menstruation on lung function. The study was performed in 141 076 women from the UK Biobank. The associations of lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and spirometric restriction (F VC) were stronger in women who had had a hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy.

People with a history of depression are at increased risk for developing autoimmune diseases and vice-versa. One explanation could be that there is shared genetic risk for depression and autoimmune diseases. In our study we looked at a region of the genome called the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) The MHC is important in human immunity and harbours genetic variation that increases risk.

Physical activity and sleep duration are established risk factors for many diseases. Their aetiology is poorly understood, partly due to relying on self-reported evidence. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of device-measured physical activity andSleep duration in 91,105 UK Biobank participants.

Lung function predicts mortality and is key to the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) In a genome-wide association study in 400,102 individuals of European ancestry, we define 279 lung function signals, 139 of which are new. In combination, these variants strongly predict COPD in independent populations.

Mood instability is a core clinical feature of affective and psychotic disorders. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mood instability in 53,525 cases and 60,443 controls from UK Biobank. We found a strong genetic correlation between mood instability and MDD and a small but significant correlation with schizophrenia.

People with more grey matter, and more intact connections between regions, had slightly higher scores on the abstract puzzle tests. The strongest effects were such that higher grey matter volume in the frontal pole and greater white matter microstructure in the posterior thalamic radiations were associated with higher fluid intelligence scores.

Neuroticism is an important risk factor for psychiatric traits, including depression1, anxiety2,3, and schizophrenia4-6. We conducted a large GWAS meta-analysis (n = 449,484) of neuroticism and identified 136 independent genome-wide significant loci. We show that neuroticism's genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters ('depressed affect' and 'worry')

Aortic distensibility can be calculated using semi-automated methods to segment the aortic lumen on cine CMR images. These methods require visual quality control and manual localization of the region of interest (ROI) of ascending (AA) and proximal descending (PDA) aorta. Using 5,100 scans from UK Biobank, this study sought to develop and validate a fully automated method.

Risk-taking behaviour is a key component of several psychiatric disorders. It could influence lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol use, and diet. Identifying genetic determinants of this trait has the potential to improve our understanding.

60 genetic variants have been robustly associated with birthweight. It is unclear whether these associations represent the effect of an individual's own genotype on their birthweight, their mother's genotype, or both. We demonstrate how structural equation modelling can be used to estimate both maternal and fetal effects.

Study included 126,182 postmenopausal women from UK Biobank. Overall, coffee consumption was not associated with breast cancer risk. Women with no PMH history who consumed &#8805; 4 cups/day had a 16% reduced risk of breast cancer.

Heritability estimation provides important information about the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to phenotypic variation. We demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes to a broad array of quantitative traits and human diseases in the UK population. We identify phenotypes whose heritability is moderated by age, sex and socioeconomic status.

Seasonality of total depressive symptom scores, anhedonia and tiredness scores was observed in women but not men, with peaks in winter. Shorter days were associated with increased feelings of low mood and anhedonian in women.

We used a Mendelian randomization approach to examine a potential causal effect of vitamin B12 and folate on hay fever, asthma, and selected biomarkers of allergy. We included 162,736 participants from 9 population-based studies including the UK Biobank. Results were combined in instrumental variable and meta-analyses and effects expressed as odds ratios (ORs)

Body mass index (BMI) is positively associated with asthma. We examined the causal effect of BMI on asthma, hay fever, allergic sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) A genetic risk score was created using 26 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

There is strong evidence that people born in winter and in spring have a small increased risk of schizophrenia. This 'season of birth' effect underpins some of the most influential hypotheses concerning potentially modifiable risk exposures. Here we sought to determine whether the season of birth effect reflects gene-environment confounding.

Study looked at the prevalence and incidence of chronic co-morbidities in people with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMDs) The relationship between the presence (versus absence) of a (co-)morbidity and physical activity level (low, moderate, high) was assessed.

Low levels of blood cholesterol are known to be associated with increased risk of infectious disease. It remains unclear if this relationship is causal in nature. This study assessed the influence of common variants associated with blood lipid levels on infectious disease risk in individuals of British Caucasian ancestry from the UK Biobank.

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor for glaucoma. We constructed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for IOP using the UK Biobank (UKB) data set. We examined the associations of the PRSs with IOP and primary open-angle glau coma (POAG) using linear and logistic regression.

Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may reflect different pathways linking activity to brain health. Previous work has confirmed the benefits of aerobic exercise for brain aging, however mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.

Researchers analysed genetic variants that predict testosterone levels and their associations with blood clots (thromboembolism), heart failure and heart attack. Participants were aged 40 to 75 years and most were of British or European ancestry. Heart conditions were identified from self-reports, hospital and death records and results were validated using data from another large genome study.

Some of the most widely studied variants in psychiatric genetics include variable number tandem repeat variants (VNTRs) These loci remain absent from the largest available samples, such as the UK Biobank. Here, we report out-of-sample imputation accuracy estimates of >0.96 for all four VNTR variants.

Testosterone supplementation has been linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk in some observational studies. We assessed genetic associations of variants in two gene regions that are predictors of testosterone (SHBG and JMJD1C)

We propose a method based on deep learning to perform cardiac segmentation on short axis Magnetic resonance imaging stacks. At each iteration, a novel variant of the U-net is applied to propagate the segmentation of a slice to the adjacent slice below it. Results comparable or even better than the state of the art in terms of distance measures are achieved.

In a combined sample of over 1 million individuals, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance, adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general riskolerance.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure, and premature death. The pathogenesis of AF remains poorly understood, which contributes to the current lack of highly effective treatments. To understand the genetic variation and biology underlying AF, we undertook a genome-wide association study.

We studied associations between different measures of fitness and physical activity and incident cardiovascular disease events. In addition, we evaluated these associations in individuals with different genetic risk for coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men but its aetiology is not well understood. We studied 219 335 men from the UK Biobank study. 4575 incident cases of prostate cancer occurred during 5.6 years of follow-up.

Men had greater intakes of energy and were less likely to have energy intakes above the estimated average requirement compared with women. Small, but significant, sex differences were found in the intakes of all macronutrients. Sex differences in dietary intakes moderated by age and to some extent by socioeconomic status.

 Educational attainment is associated with many health outcomes, including longevity. We used data from three large genetic epidemiology cohort studies. A 1 SD higher polygenic education score was associated with &#8764;2.7% lower mortality risk.

This project analysed data from UK Biobank participants with self-reported Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), compared to those who did not report that condition. The aim was to compare patterns of multimorbidity (more than one long term health condition) and polypharmacy.

Dietary habits are leading risk factors for life-altering diseases and mortality. Large-scale biobanks now enable genetic analysis of traits with modest heritability, such as diet. We identify 814 associated loci, including olfactory receptor associations with fruit and tea intake.

Deep learning (DL) algorithms can analyse cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, but the presence of unanticipated analysis-errors currently excludes their use in clinical practice. We developed a pipeline for DL-based analysis of cine CMR, including quality control (QC) steps that prevent erroneous outputs.

Current public health guidelines on physical activity and sleep duration are limited by a reliance on subjective self-reported evidence. Using data from simple wrist-worn activity monitors, we developed a tailored machine learning model, using balanced random forests with Hidden Markov Models, to reliably detect a number of activity modes.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) promised to translate their findings into clinically beneficial improvements of patient management. However, the ability to translate genetic findings from GWAS into predictive tools that are of clinical utility has, so far, been encouraging but limited. Here we propose to use a more powerful statistical approach, the use of which has traditionally been limited due to computational requirements and lack of sufficiently large individual level genotyped cohorts.

Physical activity (PA) protects against a wide range of diseases. Habitual PA appears to be heritable, motivating the search for specific genetic variants. We examined genetic correlations of PA with other traits and diseases.

Machine learning algorithms can be trained to estimate age from brain structural MRI. The method was trained on a dataset of healthy Icelanders and tested on two datasets, IXI and UK Biobank, utilizing transfer learning to improve accuracy on new sites.

We carried out meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the first two principal components (PCs) PC1 (global) captured variations of most regions, whereas PC2 (visual) was specific to the primary and secondary visual cortices. We then tested associations with occupational aptitudes and found that the global PC1 was associated with General Learning Ability.

Cross-sectional study examined impact of MHT on left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) structure and function. In this large cohort of post-menopausal women free of cardiovascular disease, MHT was not associated with adverse, subclinical changes in cardiac structure andfunction.

Impaired capacity to increase heart rate (HR) during exercise (&#916;HRex), and a reduced rate of recovery post-exercise (&#915;HRrec) are associated with higher cardiovascular mortality rates. Currently, the genetic basis of both phenotypes remains to be elucidated. We conduct genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in 40,000 individuals and 27,000 independent samples.

This study sough to answer whether the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was different between individuals with without genetic causes for high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood. In this cohort study of 48 741 adults recruited by the UK Biobank, a monogenic cause for hypercholesterolemia was found in 277 participants (0.57%) and a polygenic cause in 2379 participants (4.9%).

 Differences in cardiac and aortic structure and function are associated with cardiovascular diseases and a wide range of other types of disease. Here we analyzed cardiovascular magnetic resonance images from a population-based study, the UK Biobank, using an automated machine-learning-based analysis pipeline. We report a comprehensive range of structural and functional phenotypes for the heart and aorts across 26,893 participants.

Using a meta-scoring approach, we develop a metaGRS for ischaemic stroke (IS) We analyse this score in the UK Biobank (n = 395,393; 3075 IS events by age 75) The MetaGRS hazard ratio for IS (1.26, 95% CI 1.22-1.31) doubles that of a previous GRS.

We present an atlas of genetic associations for 118 non-binary and 660 binary traits of 452,264 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Results are compiled in a publicly accessible database that allows querying genome-wide association results for 9,113,133 genetic variants.

 Moderate coffee consumption has been inversely associated with mortality. It remained unclear whether heavy intake, particularly among those with common genetic polymorphisms that impair caffeine metabolism, increases risk of mortality. In this large prospective cohort study of a half million people, we found inverse associations for coffee drinking.

 genome-wide association study identified 1,362 independent SNPs that clustered into 899 loci of which 613 are new. Data were used to train a genetic algorithm using 22,886 SNPs as predictors. Combining this genetic algorithm with height, weight, age and sex resulted in a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.496.

This study aimed to investigate associations between fat mass (i.e., body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC], and waist to hip ratio [WTHR]) and hippocampal volumes. Our findings indicate that the detrimental effects of overweight/obesity on the neurological health of individuals may extend beyond the duration of overweight.

Common variant heritability has been widely reported to be concentrated in variants within cell-type-specific non-coding functional annotations. Little is known about low-frequency variant functional architectures. We partitioned the heritability of both low- frequency (0.5%&#8804; minor allele frequency) and high-frequency variants.

We conducted a Genome wide association study of a suicidality scale. We validated our results by using Polygenic risk scoring ( a method that allows us to calculate an individual s genetic loading for a trait. We found that the loading for suicIDality was higher in those who had committed suicide.

Coffee-related genetic variants could be used as proxies for coffee consumption in Mendelian randomization studies. Study examined their association with non-alcoholic beverage consumption and a range of socio-demographic and life-style factors. Genetic risk scores demonstrated positive associations with caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and tea consumption.

Research examining associations between air pollution exposure and respiratory symptoms in adults has generally been inconclusive. This may be related in part to sample size issues, which also preclude analysis in potentially vulnerable subgroups. We estimated associations between. air pollution exposures and the prevalence of wheeze and shortness of breath. using harmonized baseline data from two very large European cohorts.

Ambient air pollution increases the risk of respiratory mortality. Evidence for impacts on lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is less well established. We used UK Biobank data on 303 887 individuals aged 40-69 years. COPD was associated with higher concentrations of PM 2.5 and PM 10.

The UK Biobank is a large-scale population-based study utilising cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to generate measurements of atrial and ventricular structure and function. Age, sex, ethnicity (non-modifiable), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood. pressure, smoking status, exercise, body mass index (BMI), high cholesterol, diabetes, alcohol intake (modifiable) were considered important cardiovascular risk factors.

Genetic factors are believed to affect risk for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) There have been no sufficiently powered and adequately sized studies. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the large UK Biobank population-based cohort.

Those who very rarely consume alcohol performed better than moderate drinkers. As consumption increased beyond moderate consumption performance declined. To preserve cognitive performance drinkers should limit their average daily consumption to 8 grams of alcohol.

Habitual coffee consumption has been associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and sarcopenia. In addition, caffeine intake stimulates attention and vigilance, and reduces reaction time. A protective effect of coffee on the risk of falling can be hypothesized.

In observational studies, early menopause is associated with lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and a higher risk of spirometric restriction, but not airflow obstruction. It is, however, unclear if this association is causal. We used a Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach, which is not affected by classical confounding. We included 94 742 naturally post-menopausal women from the UK Biobank.

KnockoffZoom is a flexible method that localizes causal variants at multiple resolutions. It tests the conditional associations of genetic segments of decreasing width. The method can detect more associations than mixed effects models.

Cigarette smoking is associated with increased risk for myriad health consequences including cognitive decline and dementia. In the current study, we assessed the relationship of cigarette smoking with gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in the UK Biobank. Ever smoked and duration were associated with smaller total GM volume.

Some previous evidence has linked dairy products with greater muscle mass, bone mineral density and lower risk of osteoporosis. Other authors have found a detrimental effect of milk on the risk of hip fracture.

The adverse impact of visual impairment and blindness and correlations with socioeconomic position are known. Understanding of the effect of the substantially more common near-normal vision (mild impairment) and associations with social position as well as health and life chances is limited.

One type of white blood cell which is commonly assessed with regular blood samples by your GP may be helpful in determining men at higher risk than others. This is taking into account all their other known risk factors.

For every additional drink consumed per day of total fluid, the risk of kidney stones declined by 13%. Similar patterns of associations were observed for tea, coffee, and alcohol. Fruit and fibre intake was also associated with a lower risk. Meat and salt intake was associated with higher risk. Vegetable, fish, and cheese intake was not associated with kidney stones.

Over 350,000 people from across the UK told us the mode(s) of transport they used to get to work. We linked this to information from hospital admission data, cancer registries and death certificates. More active patterns of travel were associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks and deaths.

To assess the relationship between physical activity levels and the risk of disease or death, researchers have to follow study participants over a period of time. Prior to this study, it was not known whether the length of that follow-up time makes a difference to the relationships seen. Using UK Biobank data, we investigated the relationships between. physical activity and mortality and cardiovascular disease.

Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a common and life-threatening heart disease. Current treatment options cannot stop or delay its progression. PALMD (palmdelphin) was found to be significantly associated with CAVS.

More severe depressive symptoms were associated with reduced likelihood of breast (OR = 0.960, 95% CI: 0.950,0.970) and cervical screening participation, in cross-sectional analyses. Higher neuroticism scores were linked to reduced cervical screening, but the opposite was found for breast cancer screening.

Suicide is a worldwide public health problem with more than 800,000 deaths due to suicide each year. Rates of suicide are far exceeded by suicide attempts, which occur up to 20 times more frequently, making suicidality a huge personal, social and economic burden.

Dental caries and periodontitis account for a vast burden of morbidity and healthcare spending, yet their genetic basis remains largely uncharacterized. We identify self-reported dental disease proxies which have similar underlying genetic contributions to clinical disease measures. We then combine these in a genome-wide association study meta-analysis, identifying 47 novel and conditionally-independent risk loci for dental caries.

Fifty four percent of participants aged 40-69 years had refractive error. 27% had myopia (4% high myopia), which was more common amongst younger people, those of higher socio-economic status, or of White or Chinese ethnicity. frequency of hypermetropia increased with age, was higher in women and its severity was associated with ethnicity.

UK Biobank study included 117 278 participants aged 40 to 69 years in 6 regional centers in England and Wales. Patients underwent autorefraction measurement. Spherical equivalent in the more extreme eye was used to categorize myopia and hypermetropia.

Women with premature and early menopause had a substantially increased risk of a non-fatal cardiovascular disease event before the age of 60 years, but not after age 70 years. Compared with women who hadMenopause at age 50 51 years, women with premature had an increased risk.

Mean ages were 12.9 years at menarche, 25.7 years at first birth, and 50.5 years at natural menopause. The prevalence of nulliparity rose progressively from 14% of women born from 1940 49 to 22% of woman born 1970 84. Women with higher education levels had fewer children, later first birth and laterMenopause than women with lower education levels.

Early menopause is associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) Few studies have investigated the converse. We examined whether premenopausal CVD events are associated with early age atMenopause. We pooled data of 177,131 women from nine studies.

 duration of smoking was a strong predictor of age at natural menopause. Smokers who had quit smoking for more than 10 years had similar risk as never smokers.

A group of experts in mental health disorders in the population worked together with UK Biobank scientists to design and send out a questionnaire about mental health. The questionnaire aimed to tell the difference between participants who had experienced depression, anxiety or addiction disorders and those who had not. They also asked about self-harm and unusual experiences, and about their overall wellbeing. The people who responded tended to be more educated and slightly more healthy.

Between 2009 and 2010, 117 281 subjects recruited by UK Biobank undertook an ophthalmic assessment, including autorefraction. Of those with refractive error within a range eligible for laser refractive surgery (n = 60 352), 1892 (3.1%) reported having bilateralRefractive surgery and 549 (0.9%) unilateral surgery. Frequency of bilateral surgery decreased with increasing age and was higher in women.

Heart failure (HF) is a morbid and heritable disorder for which the biological mechanisms are incompletely understood. We examined genetic associations with HF in a large national biobank. We refined the HF phenotype by classifying individuals with left ventricular dysfunction as having nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM)

We performed large-scale, deep-coverage whole genome sequencing to identify genetic variants related to atrial fibrillation. Rare variation in the gene TTN, encoding the sarcomeric protein titin, was associated with early-onset AF. The findings from common and rare variant analyses were successfully replicated using UKBB and MyCode studies.

Cardiac rhythm abnormalities are prevalent in community-dwelling adults. New rhythm abnormalities developed at a rate of nearly 0.5%/year. Risk of incident cardiac rhythm abnormalities is increased in the setting of older age, male sex, traditional cardiac risk factors, and chronic kidney disease.

Using the UK Biobank, we performed a phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) for 12 AF risk factors. Distinct clusters of variants were associated with AF as well as height, BMI, and hypertension. Results extend our understanding of the biological pathways underlying AF and may facilitate the development of therapeutics for AF.

Lifetime risk of AF is nearly 37 % in individual of European ancestry. Individuals who have higher genetics risk or clinical risks would have higher chance to develop AF. Patients who have a lower clinical risk burden were associated with a later AF onset time.

The UK Biobank assessed Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and self-reported lifetime exposure to traumatic events in 126,522 genotyped individuals of European ancestry. The SNP-based heritability of MDD with reported trauma exposure (24%) was greater than MDD without trauma exposure.

Tobacco and alcohol use are leading causes of mortality that influence risk for many complex diseases and disorders. They are heritable2,3 and etiologically related behaviors that have been resistant to gene discovery efforts. In sample sizes up to 1.2 million individuals, we discovered 566 genetic variants in 406 loci associated with multiple stages of tobacco use.

Smoking and alcohol use have been associated with common genetic variants in multiple loci. Rare variants within these loci hold promise in the identification of biological mechanisms in substance use. Exome arrays and genotype imputation can now efficiently genotype rare nonsynonymous and loss of function variants.

APOE e4 genotype is found in about 25% of the general population. It is a known risk factor for dementia. It has sometimes been called the 'frailty gene' partly because it seems to increase vulnerability.

Ever-drinking versus non-drink was positively associated with hay fever and inversely with asthma. Genetic predisposition to consume more alcohol did not affect risk of hay fever, asthma, allergic sensitization or serum levels of total IgE. The discrepancy of results between observational and Mendelian randomization analyses could be due to potential residual confounding.

There is no "correct" indicator - all will have advantages and disadvantages. The decision of which indicators to use, and how to combine, will depend on the aims of the study.

Cannabis use is a heritable trait that has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes. UK Biobank data was combined to create the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for lifetime cannabis use to date (N=184,765)

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. We performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls)

The Default-mode network (DMN) is a key functional network of the human brain. We conducted genome-wide association analysis to find regions of the genome linked to variation in the functional activity of the DMN. We found that the set of brain-expressed HAR genes to be significantly associated with the phenotypic variation in DMN amplitude.

The link between personality traits and cognitive performance has been extensively studies. Neuroticism and executive functions seem to be particularly involved, and reduced executive function has been proposed to underlie the association of neuroticism with sedentary behaviors and fatty food consumption.

Mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) is the most commonly reported large structural somatic event. Previous studies have indicated age and cigarette smoking increase the risk of mLOY. Relationship of other exposures with mLOY and mLOY with disease has not been adequately investigated.

Apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 genotype is an accepted risk factor for accelerated cognitive aging and dementia. The deleterious effects of this genotype on brain structure may increase in magnitude into older age. This study aimed to investigate the association between APOE e4 allele presence vs. absence and brain imaging variables that have been associated with worse cognitive abilities.

Stroke increases the likelihood of social isolation and stroke survivors are at high risk of cognitive decline. We assessed the association between social engagement and cognitive function in a sample of stroke survivors.

Osteoporotic fractures are a major healthcare problem affecting worldwide more than 9 million individuals every year. Genetic predisposition to other clinical risk factors like vitamin D levels and calcium intake were not found to be directly predisposing fracture. interventions aimed at increasing bone and muscle strength are more likely to be successful in preventing fractures.

Study explored impact of our physical health, such as body weight, heart health and blood pressure. We tested 11 measures of physical health including coronary artery disease, heart attack, cholesterol, blood pressure, body fat and BMI. Results suggested a consistent causal effect of higher BMI on lower mental wellbeing.

Frailty indices (FIs) measure variation in health between aging individuals. Researching FIs in resources with large-scale genetic and phenotypic data will provide insights into the causes and consequences of frailty. We aimed to develop an FI using UK Biobank data, a cohort study of 500,000 middle-aged and older adults.

Research analyses whether personalised weight feedback resulted in individuals losing weight over a period of between 2 and 7 years. The effect of feedback was found to be strongly moderated by household income, with those in higher income households accounting for seemingly all of the estimated effect due to increased physical activity.

COPD is the leading cause of respiratory mortality worldwide. We performed a genome-wide association study in 35,735 cases and 222,076 controls. We identified 82 loci associated with P.

Coffee is one of the most widely consumed stimulants worldwide. Increased risk of myocardial infarction and hypertension has been suggested for individuals who carry a functional variant at cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2)

Coffee's long-term effect on cognitive function remains unclear with studies suggesting both benefits and adverse effects. We used Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal relationship between habitual coffee consumption and cognitive function. This included up to 415,530 participants and 300,760 coffee drinkers from 10 European ancestry cohorts.

 serum 25(OH)D concentration as a causal factor for cognitive performance in mid- to later life. In this study, we combined results from 17 cohorts (with UK Biobank being the largest study)

UK Biobank recruited over 500,000 people aged 40 to 69 years. Participants provided detailed information on health and lifestyle factors including pain and alcohol consumption. Total units consumed per week were calculated for current drinkers. Information was also collected on changes in alcohol consumption and reasons for such changes.

UK Biobank, a cohort study of 0.5 million people aged 40-69 years, recruited throughout Great Britain in 2006-2010. Participants reporting 'pain all over the body' for >3 months were compared with persons without chronic pain.

Hearing loss is associated with changes in brain volume in regions supporting auditory and cognitive processing. Whole-brain gray matter volume was significantly lower for individuals with poorer SRTn. The greatest percentage difference (-0.57%) in ROI volume was found in the left superior temporal gyrus. There was no conclusive evidence that this effect is moderated by hearing aid use.

Study aims to test whether polygenic risk for Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with cognitive function and physical health in the UK Biobank. Higher polygenicrisk for AD, ALS, and FTD was associated with lower cognitive performance.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a public health priority for the 21st century. Risk reduction currently revolves around lifestyle changes with much research trying to elucidate the biological underpinnings. We show that self-report of parental history of Alzheimer's dementia is a valid proxy for an AD genetic study.

Study looked at 449,073 UK Biobank participants. Suicide occurred more frequently in those who had high levels of distress. Also scored high in neuroticism and had history of seeing a psychiatrist.

Early menarche, early menopause, earlier age at first birth, and a history of miscarriage, stillbirth or hysterectomy were each associated with a higher risk of CVD in later life. Women who had given birth to more children also had higher subsequent CVD risk.

Excess adipose tissue is a major risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI) There are substantial differences in the distribution of fat between women and men. Measures of central adiposity, particularly waist-to-hip ratio, were more strongly associated with the risk of MI.

Low birthweight has been associated with a higher risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), and cardiovascular disease. The Barker hypothesis posits that intrauterine growth restriction resulting in lower birthweight is causal for these diseases. We performed regression analyses to assess associations of birthweight with cardiovascular disease and T2D.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common complication among individuals with diabetes. A better understanding of the genetic background of CAD in this population could suggest novel molecular targets for screening, risk assessment and drug development.

Large-scale studies of risk factors for varicose veins may highlight important aspects of pathophysiology and identify groups at increased risk for disease. Machine learning confirmed several known (age, sex, obesity, pregnancy, history of deep vein thrombosis) and identified several new risk factors, including height.

Higher blood pressure indices, smoking intensity, body mass  index, and the presence of diabetes were associated with an increased risk of MI in men and women. Sex specific associations between risk factors and MI declined with age, but, where it occurred, the higher relative risk in women remained.

To date, the effects of the co-occurrence of stroke with other long term conditions have been poorly explored. Increasing multimorbidity was associated with higher all-cause mortality. Mortality risk was double for those with =5 comorbidities.

Isolated and lonely people are at increased risk of death. Health policies addressing risk factors such as adverse socioeconomic conditions, unhealthy lifestyle, and lower mental wellbeing might reduce excess mortality.

More than one in three adults worldwide is either overweight or obese. The location and distribution of excess fat is more informative for predicting risk of obesity sequelae, including cardiometabolic disease and cancer.

Muscle mass measures are used in the current definitions of sarcopenia. Their usefulness is uncertain because of limited data on their association with health outcomes. This study compared the performance of different muscle mass measures in predicting incident osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

In December 2019, a novel disease, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, People's Republic of China. To date, over 300,000 cases of CO VID-19 have been reported in England and over 40,000 patients have died. Recent studies have identified links between air pollution and death rates.

Ongoing studies show that higher hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) predicts coronary artery disease (CAD) It remains unclear whether this association is driven entirely by glycemia. We used Mendelian randomization to test whether A1C is causally associated with CAD through glycemic and/or nonglycemic factors.

UK Biobank study recruited 40-70-year-olds in 2006-2010. 2658 had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 948 tested positive (726 in hospital) Black and south Asian groups were more likely to test positive.

Coffee consumption and cigarette smoking are strongly associated, but whether this association is causal remains unclear. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses of observational data. In-vitro experiments assessed the effect of caffeic acid, quercetin and p-coumaric acid on the rate of nicotine metabolism.

Cigarette smokers are at increased risk of poor sleep behaviors. It is largely unknown whether these associations are due to shared (genetic) risk factors and/or causal effects (which may be bidirectional) We found evidence that smoking more cigarettes causally decreases the odds of being a morning person.

We found some evidence that personality traits are causally linked to certain smoking phenotypes. Among current smokers each additional neuroticism risk allele was associated with smoking an additional 0.07 cigarettes per day. Evidence in the reverse direction, from smoking initiation to personality was weaker.

Recent studies have suggested that even low-intensity smoking might be associated with increased mortality. Smoking is associated with lower socio-economic status as well as other potential risk factors. Disease onset might motivate smoking cessation, thus residual confounding and reverse causality might bias results.

 Observational studies on smoking and risk of hay fever and asthma have shown inconsistent results. However, observational studies may be biased by confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as markers of exposures to examine causal effects.

Cigarette smoke increases metabolism of caffeine, so this may represent a causal effect of smoking on caffeine intake. Each additional cigarette per day consumed by current smokers was associated with higher coffee consumption. There was weak evidence for an increase in tea consumption per additional cigarette smoked per day.

There is strong evidence of a positive association between cigarette and alcohol consumption. We tested whether smoking is likely to increase alcohol consumption using a genetic variant (rs1051730/rs16969968)

Frailty and multimorbidity have been suggested as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. We investigated whether these factors were associated with risk of hospitalisation. We intend to further investigate the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae.

 increases in fat-free mass and fat mass have been associated with higher risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in observational studies. Our aim was to evaluate independent causal roles of fat- free mass andfat mass on AF.

UK Biobank participants without cardiovascular disease aged 39-70 completed psychiatric questions relating International Classification of Diseases-10 Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic criteria on a touchscreen questionnaire at baseline interview in 2006-2010.

Urine biomarkers reflecting kidney function and handling of dietary sodium and potassium are strongly associated with several common diseases. Knowledge about the genetic determinants of these biomarkers may shed light on pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of these diseases. We highlight GIPR, a potential diabetes drug target, as possibly implicated in the genetic control of urinary potassium excretion.

Data on 36 chronic conditions from 502,643 participants aged 40 to 69 years were extracted from the UK Biobank. The likelihood of co-occurrence of these conditions is 13 times higher than in isolation. Conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma are the epicenter of disease clusters for multimorbidity.

We examined whether social isolation and loneliness predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke among those with no history of AMI or stroke. We also examined the extent to which these associations are explained by known risk factors or pre-existing chronic conditions. Participants were 479,054 individuals from the UK Biobank.

Multimorbidity is associated with higher mortality, but the relationship with cancer and cardiovascular mortality is unclear. The influence of demographics and type of condition on the relationship of multimorbidy with mortality remains unknown. We examine the relationship between multim orbidity and cause of mortality and the impact of demographic factors on this relationship.

People with higher cognitive ability tend to behave in a healthier fashion as regards risk factors for lower respiratory tract infection. There is evidence that they have a lower risk of dying from respiratory disease as a whole.

It is traditional to use data on the underlying cause of death on death certificates. We found associations with known risk factors were essentially the same. This finding has implications when studying risk factors for rare causes of death.

UK Biobank is unusual in that only 6% of people invited to take part in its initial survey agreed to do so. The low response rate has led to debate as to whether findings of links between risk factors and disease are likely to be generalizable.

Using Mendelian randomization, the researchers analyzed genetic variants that predict HbA1c levels and their associations with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The researchers applied the usual selection criteria for participants in genetic studies, such as including only participants of genetically verified white British descent. The positive association was clearer when invalid genetic instruments were excluded.

Associations between cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and the biventricular geometry of the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricles (LV) have been difficult to assess. We sought to quantify reference RV morphology as well as bivocentular variations associated with common cardiovascular risk factors. A biv centrifugal shape atlas was automatically constructed using contours and landmarks from 4329 UK Biobank cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies.

Urinary sodium excretion correlates with elevated blood pressure in subjects at low cardiovascular risk. No pattern of increased cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or mortality risk was demonstrated with either high or low sodium intake. Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) measurements are central to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. There is continuing debate around the utility of other lipids for risk prediction.

UK Biobank is a prospective study of half a million subjects, almost all aged 40-69 years. 14,285 subjects were diagnosed with cancer during a median of 5.1 years of follow-up. A healthy lifestyle based on all five behaviours was associated with a reduction of about one-third in incident cancer.

Machine learning was used to identify risk factors for incident heart failure. Leg bioimpedance was identified as a new marker which was further explored in confirmatory analyses.

Study of association between genetic variants in PCSK9 and phenotypes across the spectrum of human disease. Uses UK Biobank data for discovery and replication of findings.

Using a continuous exposure variable that is measured with random error in a univariable linear regression model leads to regression dilution bias. A repeatability sub-study, where a sample of study participants have their data measured again, can be used to correct for this bias. It is important to perform a sample size calculation for such a sub- study to ensure that correction factors can be estimated with sufficient precision.

Arterial stiffness index (ASI) is a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness using infra-red finger sensors (photoplethysmography) ASI is a well-suited measure for large populations as it is relatively inexpensive to perform.

Heart rate (HR) responds to exercise by increasing during exercise and recovering after exercise. HR is an important predictor of mortality that researchers believe is modulated by the autonomic nervous system. The mechanistic basis underlying inter-individual differences has yet to be explained.

 driving is a common type of sedentary behaviour; an independent risk factor for poor health. Study explores whether driving is also associated with other unhealthy lifestyle factors.

Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 60 years), and those living outside of Greater London (OR=0.53 to 0.77), with borderline trends for a lower body mass index, higher oily fish intake and higher household income.

This work investigates whether genetic makeup moderates the effects of education on health. The additional schooling affected body size, lung function, and blood pressure in middle age. The improvements in body size and lung function were larger for individuals with high genetic predisposition to obesity.

We examined associations between BMI and the number of formal physical activity (PA) facilities within 1 km of each individual's home. We found that the association between a greater number of local PA facilities and lower BMI was stronger among people with fewer urban green spaces in their neighbourhood. We conclude that formal PA facilities may buffer against a lack of informal, green resources for PA.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of medication use may contribute to understanding of disease etiology. GWASs could generate new leads relevant for drug discovery and can be used to quantify future risk.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure and the leading indication for heart transplantation. Many rare genetic variants have been associated with DCM, but common variant studies of the disease have yielded few associated loci. We report a genome-wide association study of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived left ventricular measurements in 36,041 UK Biobank participants.

Ivabradine is a heart rate lowering drug with protective effects on heart failure despite increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation. In patients with coronary artery disease without heart failure, the drug does not protect against major cardiovascular adverse events prompting questions about the ability of genetics to have predicted those effects. This study evaluates the effect of a variant in HCN4 on safety and efficacy endpoints.

We construct risk predictors using polygenic scores (PGS) computed from common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for a number of complex disease conditions. We obtain values for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the range of 0.58-0.71 using SNP data alone. Substantially higher predictor AUCs are obtained when incorporating additional variables such as age and sex.

Genomic prediction of complex human traits and disease risks has advanced considerably in recent years. Using data from the UK Biobank, predictors have been constructed using penalized algorithms that favor sparsity. The state of these SNPs cannot be determined from exome-sequencing data.

We test 26 polygenic predictors using tens of thousands of genetic siblings from the UK Biobank. We compare validation results obtained using non-sibling subjects to those obtained among siblings. We find that typically most of the predictive power persists in between-s sibling designs.

We construct genomic predictors for heritable but extremely complex human quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational attainment) The constructed predictors explain, respectively, &#8764;40, 20, and 9% of total variance for the three traits. The proportion of variance explained for height is comparable to the estimated common SNP heritability from genome-wide complex trait analysis.

Physical activity (PA) levels between individuals with and without cancer. Current cancer, cancer survivor and cancer-free groups were identified from the UK Biobank. Participants in the two cancer groups had fewer minutes in moderate-to-vigorous PA per day.

Multiple studies have reported genetic associations with prognostic outcomes of urinary bladder cancer. We have used SNPTEST software to replicate previously reported associations. Using our algorithm, we have identified 618 recurrence and 58 UBC progression events. In total, there were 209 deaths (106 UBC-specific)

 Mutations in UGT1A gene have been associated with the development and prognosis of urinary bladder cancer (UBC) We investigated the potential effect of mild hyperbilirubinemia on UBC risk. No effects were observed for events of UBC recurrence, progression, or survival.

Fish oil supplementation is widely used for reducing serum triglycerides (TAGs) but has mixed effects on other circulating cardiovascular biomarkers. Many genetic polymorphisms have been associated with blood lipids, including high- and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C), total cholesterol, and TAGs. Here, the gene-diet interaction effects of fish oil supplementation on these lipids were analyzed in a discovery cohort of up to 73,962 UK Biobank participants.

Moderately raised serum bilirubin levels are associated with lower rates of lung cancer, particularly among smokers. It is not known whether these relationships reflect antioxidant properties or residual confounding. This study aimed to investigate potential causal relationships between serum total bilirubsin and lung cancer incidence using Mendelian randomisation.

Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) appear in clusters and are both associated with an increased risk of cancer. It remains unknown whether obesity status with or without MetS increases the risk of site-specific cancers. We used data derived from 390,575 individuals (37-73 years old) from the UK Biobank.

Left ventricular (LV) mass and volume are important indicators of clinical and pre-clinical disease processes. Much of the shape information present in modern imaging examinations is currently ignored. We compared two independent LV atlases using MRI scans of 4547 UK Biobank participants. The strength of associations between atlas principal components and cardiovascular risk factors were quantified.

Asthma hospitalizations account for a high proportion of asthma-related healthcare costs. In 2016, asthma affected 9.3% of people and caused ~93,000 hospitalizations in the United Kingdom (U.K.)

The recent availability of large-scale neuroimaging cohorts facilitates deeper characterisation of the relationship between phenotypic and brain architecture variation in humans. Here, we investigate the association (previously coined morphometricity) of a phenotype with all 652,283 measures of cortical and subcortical morphology in a large data set from the UK Biobank and Human Connectome Project.

Polygenic indexes (PGIs) are DNA-based predictors. Their value for research in many scientific disciplines is growing rapidly. A PGI can be understood as an unbiased but noisy measure of a latent variable. Regressions in which the true regressor is this factor but the PGI is used as its proxy therefore suffer from errors-in-variables bias.

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is positively associated with the risks of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. But evidence for other less common cancers is limited. In this study, we investigated associations between serum IGF-I concentrations and incidence of lesscommon cancers in the UK Biobank study.

Red and processed meat have been consistently associated with colorectal cancer risk. Evidence for other cancer sites and for poultry intake is limited. We analyzed data from 474 996 participants (54% women) in UK Biobank.

Less than 0.1% of the NDNS sample adhere to all nine EWG recommendations and 30.6% adhere to at least five recommendations. Compared with very low adherence, intermediate-to-high adherence was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. Increased adherence to the recommendation on red and processed meat consumption was. associated with the largest decrease in environmental footprints.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can identify the sex of an individual from color fundus photographs (CFPs) However, the mechanism(s) involved in this identification has not been determined. This study was conducted to determine the information in CFPs that can be used to determine sex.

Vigorous physical activity (PA) in highly trained athletes has been associated with heightened left ventricular (LV) trabeculation extent. It has been hypothesised that LV trabECulation extent may participate in exercise-induced physiological cardiac remodelling. In a community-based general population cohort, there was no relationship at, or between, extremes, between PA and NC/C, suggesting that at typical general population PA levels, trab Ceculation extent is not influenced by PA changes.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease have increased the scope of biological knowledge about the disease. We aimed to use the largest aggregate of GWAS data to identify novel risk loci and gain further insight into the causes. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78 genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in 37 loci.

Previous studies have suggested that altered asymmetry of the planum temporale (PT) is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Shared genetic factors have been suggested to link PT asymmetry to these disorders. In a dataset of unrelated subjects from the general population, we found that PT volume asymmetry had a significant heritability of roughly 14%.

UK Biobank recruited > 500,000 participants, aged 37-73, between 2006 and 2010. Exposures were sociodemographic (age, sex, ethnicity, education, income and deprivation), psychosocial (loneliness and social isolation), lifestyle (smoking, alcohol intake, sleep duration, BMI, physical activity and stair climbing) and environmental (air pollution, noise and residential greenspace) factors. Low income, being male, neighbourhood deprivation, loneliness, social isolation, short or long sleep duration and low or high BMI and smoking were associated with poor health.

Hand preference is a conspicuous variation in human behaviour. Around 90% of people prefer to use the right hand for many tasks, and 10% the left hand. We used the large cohort of the UK biobank (~500,000 participants) to study possible relations between early life factors and adult hand preference.

An increased serum level of free testosterone was associated with lower odds of physician-diagnosed asthma and current wheeze in women and men. Higher serum free testosterone levels were also associated with higher lung function in men.

We trained a deep learning algorithm to predict refractive error from a total of 226,870 images. We validated it on 24,007 UK Biobank and 15,750 AREDS images. The algorithm had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.56 diopters.

Anaemia can be detected via machine-learning algorithms trained using retinal  fundus images, study participant metadata (including race or ethnicity, age, sex and  blood pressure) or the combination of both data types. In a validation dataset of 11,388 study participants from the UK Biobank, the metadata-only, fundus-image-only and combined models predicted haemoglobin  concentration (in g dl-1)

Deep learning can extract new knowledge from retinal fundus images. We predicted cardiovascular risk factors not previously thought to be present or quantifiable in retinal images. The models used anatomical features, such as the optic disc or blood vessels, to generate each prediction.

Sex differences have been shown in laboratory biomarkers, but the extent to which this is due to genetics is unknown. In this study, we infer sex-specific genetic parameters across 33 quantitative biomarker traits in 181,064 females and 156,135 males from the UK Biobank study. We find that the genetics of most biomarker trait are shared between males and females.

The UK Biobank is collecting extensive data on health-related characteristics of over half a million volunteers. The biological samples of blood and urine can provide valuable insight on kidney function.

UK Biobank participants without baseline CVD or known diabetes were included. Associations of HbA1c with CVD was assessed using Cox models adjusting for classical risk factors.

Polygenic scores (PGS) have been widely used to predict disease risk using variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) To date, most GWAS have been conducted in populations of European ancestry, which limits the use of GWAS-derived PGS in non-European ancestry populations. Here, we derive a theoretical model of the relative accuracy (RA) of PGS across ancestries.

UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37-73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to test results. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably, but not after adjustment for confounders.

25(OH)D concentration was associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality univariably. Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency was not independently associated with either infection or linked mortality. Randomised trials are needed to prove a beneficial role for vitamin D.

The genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been widely used as an experimental design to detect associations between genetic variants and a phenotype. Two major confounding factors, population stratification and relatedness, could potentially lead to inflated GWAS test statistics and hence to spurious associations. Mixed linear model (MLM)-based approaches can be used to account for sample structure.

Evidence suggests that diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are associated with cancer risk. Previous studies have been limited by failure to adjust for cancer-specific risk factors, and failure to stratify by obesity.

Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants to assess the effect of intervening on a risk factor using observational data. We test for gene-gene interactions in the associations of variants with a modifiable risk factor. One genetic variant is treated as pharmacomimetic and the other as an effect modifier to find genetic subgroups of the population with different predicted response to treatment.

Cerebral small vessel disease is a major cause of stroke and dementia. Its genetic basis is incompletely understood. We perform a genetic study of three MRI markers of the disease in UK Biobank imaging data and other sources.

We determined differential gene expression in response to high glucose in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from matched individuals with type 1 diabetes with and without retinopathy. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of the glucose response genes were tested for association with diabetes. We identified folliculin ( FLCN ) as a susceptibility gene for diabetic ret inopathy.

Women with previous HDP had a higher risk for future hypertension and cardiovascular diagnoses, increased blood pressures, and lower risk for breast cancer compared with women without HDP. When taking genotype into account, HDP-positive women carrying at least 1 thymine (T) allele of rs2016347 had a lower risk of developing nonbreast cancer.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most useful non-invasive diagnostic tests for a wide array of cardiac disorders. Traditional approaches to analyzing ECGs focus on individual segments. We performed comprehensive deep phenotyping of 77,190 ECGs in the UK Biobank.

Some studies reported that mildly elevated serum bilirubin levels were associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Whether these are causal relationships remains unclear. This study aims to examine the causal effects of bilirubs on CVD, diabetes and their subtypes. Data we used in this study includes individual data from the UK Biobank cohort with 331,002 white British participants.

 COVID-19 may present with neurological signs, but whether people already affected by neurological conditions are at a higher risk of contracting it is still not known. 502,536 community-dwelling UK Biobank participants (54.4% male, mean age 56.6 +/- 10.3 years) were included. Nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders (G50-G59) were the most common conditions identified. The presence of CO VID-19 was almost doubled in neurological conditions compared to the general population.

Using the UK Biobank cohort, we extracted quintiles of self-reported weekly physical activity. Categories of measured BMI, waist circumference, and BF were generated. High physical activity was associated with lower risk of premature mortality in all strata of adiposity except for those with BMI &#8805;35 kg/m2.

Stair climbing has the potential to lower the risk of premature death, but current evidence is scarce. We aimed to examine whether daily stair climbing is associated with lower risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. We extracted information of self-reported daily flights of stairs climbed at home.

Age and female sex are risk factors for dementia. Menopause is associated with cognitive dysfunction. We studied whether age interacts with sex or menopause in explaining biomarkers of dementia during midlife.

Sex and sexual differentiation are pervasive across the tree of life. Because females and males often have substantially different functional requirements, we expect selection to differ between the sexes. Theory and population-level simulations indicate that sex-specific differences in viability would need to be very large to maintain reported levels of between-sex allelic differentiation.

ApoE e4 allele is associated with reduced longevity and increased Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Alzheimer's disease. Data were from 379,000 UK Biobank participants, aged 40 to 70 years. e2e3 had mostly lower lipid-related biomarker levels including reduced total and LDL-cholesterol.

Homozygosity for the SERPINA1  Z allele causes rare condition that can cause lung and liver disease. We conducted a large, population-based study to determine Z allele effects on >2400 phenotypes in the UK Biobank (N=303 353) Heterozygosity was strongly associated with increased height and with other nonrespiratory phenotypes.

In human and nonhuman primates, sex differences typically explain much interindividual variability.

We found 187 independent loci associated with intelligence, implicating 538 genes.

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that has insulin-sensitizing properties. Some trials of FGF21 analogs show weight loss and lipid-lowering effects. Recent studies have shown that a common allele in the F GF21 gene alters the balance of macronutrients consumed.

Strabismus refers to an abnormal alignment of the eyes leading to the loss of central binocular vision. As such, it is inherited as a complex genetic trait, affecting 2-4% of the population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for self-reported strabismes revealed a single genome- wide significant locus on chromosome 17q25.

Vitamin D has been intensively studied for its association with human health. The scope of such association and the causal role of vitamin D remain controversial. We aim to comprehensively investigate the links between vitamin D and human health through both epidemiological and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.

Using genetic liability (rather than phenotypic measures of disease) as a proxy for psychiatric disease risk can be a useful alternative for research questions that would traditionally require large cohort studies with long-term follow up. We conducted a hypothesis-free phenome-wide association study in about 330,000 participants from the UK Biobank to examine associations of polygenic risk scores.

Current genome-wide association studies do not yet capture sufficient diversity in populations and scope of phenotypes. To expand an atlas of genetic associations in non-European populations, we conducted 220 deep-phenotype genome- wide association studies. Meta-analyses with the UK Biobank and FinnGen identified 5,000 new loci.

Preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and placental abruption are among the most studied ones. Using publicly available data, we confirm that immune system and, in particular, T-cell related pathways are one of the most important drivers of pregnancy-related traits. Pathway analysis of the data reveals that cell adhesion and matrisome-related genes are also commonly involved in pregnancy pathologies.

Conventional human leukocyte antigen (HLA) imputation methods drop their performance for infrequent alleles. This reduces reliability of trans-ethnic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) fine-mapping due to inter-ethnic heterogeneity in allele frequency spectra. We develop DEEP*HLA, a deep learning method for imputing HLA genotypes.

The etiology of most complex diseases involves genetic variants, environmental factors, and gene-environment interaction (G Ã— E) effects. Compared with marginal genetic association studies, G Ã— E analysis requires more samples and detailed measure of environmental exposures. Large-scale population-based biobanks with detailed phenotypic and environmental information, such as UK-Biobank, can be ideal resources for identifying G â†’ E effects.

Time-to-event data analysis has attracted increasing attention in the genetics studies of human diseases. The Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model is one of the most used approaches. SPACox requires fitting a Cox PH regression model only once across the genome-wide analysis and then uses a saddlepoint approximation to calibrate test statistics.

The UK Biobank is a very large, prospective population-based cohort study across the United Kingdom. It provides unprecedented opportunities for researchers to investigate the relationship between genotypic information and phenotypes of interest.

Many genetic markers have been associated with variations in treatment response to analgesics, but none have been assessed in the context of combination therapies. In this study, the treatment effects of nortriptyline and morphine were tested for an association with genetic markers relevant to pain pathways. The presence of the C allele accounted for 51% of pain variance in this subgroup in response to combination treatment.

FastGWA-GLMM is a GLMM-based GWA tool that is severalfold to orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art tools. It is scalable to cohorts with millions of individuals. We applied it to the UKB data of 456,348 individuals, 11,842,647 variants and 2,989 binary traits.

Only a minority of excess alcohol drinkers develop cirrhosis. We developed and evaluated risk stratification scores to identify those at highest risk. A combination of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (PNPLA3:rs738409, SUGP1-TM6SF2:rs10401969, HSD17B13:rs6834314) and diabetes status (UK Biobank: relevant n = 6,898) worked best.

Schizophrenia has a genetic component, however it cannot be isolated to a single gene. We tested several machine learning algorithms to determine which was most effective in predicting schizophrenia.

Common musculoskeletal conditions include pain in the neck and shoulder areas. This study seeks to identify the genetic variants associated with neck or shoulder pain. It used 203 309 subjects from the UK Biobank cohort and looked for replication evidence from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and TwinsUK.

The rapid rise in prevalence over recent decades and high heritability of myopia suggest a role for gene-environment (G Ã— E) interactions in myopia susceptibility. We aimed to test the hypothesis that genetic analysis of susceptibility to visual experience-induced myopia in an animal model would identify novel G Ã— E interaction loci. Chicks aged 7 days were monocularly deprived of form vision for 4 days.

Frozen shoulder affects up to 5% of individuals aged 40-60 years. Little is known about the causes of the condition, but diabetes is a strong risk factor. We have identified genetic loci associated with frozen shoulder. Diabetes is a likely causal risk factor for the painful condition.

Raised albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) is an indicator of microvascular damage and renal disease. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with raised ACR. After excluding variants at the CUBN locus, an ACR genetic risk score was associated with a higher risk of hypertension.

Aberrant connectivity of large-scale brain networks has been observed among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) as well as in those at risk. Electroencephalographical (EEG) coherence, which measures the degree of synchrony between brain regions, may be a useful measure of connectivity patterns in neural networks for studying the genetics of AUD.

Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome and strongly associated with disability, mortality and hospitalization. The mechanisms underlying FI are multifactorial and not well understood, but a genetic basis has been suggested. Understanding the genetic determinants and biological mechanisms underpinning FI may help to delay or even prevent frailty.

Research suggests that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1&#946; has a modulatory effect on the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a brain structure important for learning and memory as well as linked with both psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we used an imaging genetics strategy to test an association between an IL-1 &#9 46; polygenic score and hippocampal volume.

Computational analysis showed that shared genetic loci are enriched in immune/inflammatory systems and tissues with epithelium cells.

Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder globally. We aimed to identify pleiotropic loci associated with bone mineral density and nonbone phenotypes in genome-wide association studies.

11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified. 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidity affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components.

Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) can be mitigated, but not cured or eliminated. To identify genetic influences underlying ARHI, we conducted a genome-wide association study of ARHI in 6,527 cases and 45,882 controls among the non-Hispanic whites from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort.

Body mass index (BMI), a proxy measure for obesity, is determined by both environmental (including ethnicity, age, and sex) and genetic factors. However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among BMI, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. We utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged BMI measurements from 100,418 adults.

Cataract is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly worldwide. Cataract surgery is one of the most common operations performed in the United States. As the genetic etiology of cataract formation remains unclear, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis.

We conducted an integrated study of prostate cancer genetic etiology in two cohorts using custom genotyping microarrays, large imputation reference panels, and functional annotation approaches. 11,984 men (6,196 prostate cancer cases and 5,788 controls) of European ancestry from Northern California Kaiser Permanente were genotyped and meta-analyzed with 196,269 men from the UK Biobank. Three novel loci, including two rare variants (European ancestry minor allele frequency  HOXB13 ), were identified.

Few efforts have been paid to evaluate the potential relationships between brain imaging and intelligence until now. We performed a two-stage analysis to systematically explore the relationships between 3144 brain image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and intelligence. Our findings may help to understand the genetic mechanisms of the effects of brain structure and function on the development of intelligence.

Lung function is a heritable complex phenotype with obesity being one of its important risk factors. Most genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for lung function have been based on European populations. Large-scale lung function GWASs in other populations are lacking.

Different exposures, including diet, physical activity, or external conditions can contribute to genotype-environment interactions (GÃ—E) Although high-dimensional environmental data are increasingly available, multi-environment tests for GÃ—E are not established. Here, we propose the structured linear mixed model (StructLMM), a computationally efficient method to identify and characterize loci that interact with one or more environments.

Nasal polyps (NP) are lesions on the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa and are a risk factor for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) We performed genome-wide association studies on NP and CRS in Iceland and the UK. Most notably, a missense variant in ALOX15 that causes a p.Thr560Met alteration in arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) confers significant protection against NP.

Machine-learning techniques have helped solve a broad range of prediction problems. They are not widely used to build polygenic risk scores for the prediction of complex traits. We propose a novel heuristic based on machine- learning techniques (GraBLD) to boost the predictive performance of polygenicrisk scores.

CKD is highly prevalent in the elderly population. It is rarely investigated whether kidney function is causally linked to biological aging itself. Genetic instruments for telomere attrition were applied to a CKDGen genome wide association study results for 41,395 cases of CKD.

Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is a marker of diabetic nephropathy and microvascular damage. Metabolic-related traits are observationally associated with ACR, but their causal role is uncertain. MR suggested that seven traits have causal effects on ACR.

Interactions between genetic variants-epistasis-is pervasive in model systems. Interactions can profoundly impact evolutionary adaption, population disease dynamics, genetic mapping, and precision medicine efforts. We develop a model for structured polygenic epistasis, called coordinated epistasis (CE)

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Much of the genetic risk remains unaccounted for, especially in African-Americans. We identify 24 loci (P)

Motion atlases can be used to learn descriptors that are linked to different pathologies and which can subsequently be used for diagnosis. In this work we propose a framework to build a multimodal cardiac motion atlas from 3D magnetic resonance and 3D ultrasound data.

The identification of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies is challenging due to the unknown nature of the interactions. Parametric regression models are suitable to look for prespecified interactions. Nonparametric models such as tree ensemble models have previously been difficult to interpret.

Gene-environment (GxE) interactions are one of the least studied aspects of the genetic architecture of human traits and diseases. The environment of an individual is inherently high dimensional, evolves through time and can be expensive and time consuming to measure. We show that GPLEMMA is more computationally efficient than LEMMA on large datasets.

The genetic variant rs72824905-G (minor allele) in the PLCG2 gene was previously associated with a reduced Alzheimer's disease risk (AD) We found an association with reduced risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) We did not find evidence for an effect on Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS)

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease, but its genetic aetiology remains poorly characterised. To identify novel susceptibility loci for OA, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in individuals from the largest UK-based OA collections to date.

Depression is a leading cause of worldwide disability. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding its neural and behavioural associations. We report 77 traits that are significantly associated with depression-PRS. Mendelian Randomisation analysis supports a potential causal effect of liability to depression on brain white matter microstructure.

Using human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms, we systematically mapped 60 phenotypes related to AS, MS, DS and NS in 337,198 unrelated white British. We performed logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components. Overall, we observed multiple phenotype-genotype correlations, such as the association between variation in JAG1, FBN1, PTPN11 and SOS2 with blood pressure.

Some commonly prescribed drugs are associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. fracture risk stratification using skeletal measures is not often performed to identify those at risk before these medications are prescribed. We tested whether a genomically predicted skeletal measure, speed of sound (gSOS) from heel ultrasound, is an independent risk factor for fracture in users of fracture-related drugs.

 LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) risk score (PRS) not well understood, both within the general population and individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) We developed the HDL-C PRS using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression in 377 286 White British participants from UK Biobank. We tested its association with LDL- C according to FH variant carrier status in another 41 748 whole-exome sequenced individuals.

Adult height is highly heritable, yet no genetic predictor has demonstrated clinical utility compared to mid-parental height. A polygenic risk score was constructed based on meta-analysis of genomewide association studies and evaluated on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

Increasing childhood obesity rates are associated with not only adverse physical, but also mental health outcomes, including depression. These negative outcomes may be caused and/or exacerbated by the bullying and shaming overweight individuals experience. We hypothesized that a genetic risk for higher BMI, will predict higher early life stress (ELS), which in turn will Predict higher depressive symptoms in adulthood.

An individual's genetics can dramatically influence breast cancer (BC) risk. Clinical measures for prevention do exist, but non-invasive personalized measures for reducing BC risk are limited. No previous study has explored whether a range of widely taken approved drugs modulate BC genetics.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Rare point mutations and copy number gains of the SNCA gene have been shown to cause autosomal dominant PD. Common DNA variants identified using Genome-Wide Association Studies are a moderate risk factor for PD.

Tests of association between a phenotype and a set of genes in a biological pathway can provide insights into the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes. Most existing gene set tests have limited power to detect gene set-phenotype association when a small fraction of the genes are associated with the phenotype.

We propose a deep probabilistic model for local anomaly detection in sequences of heart shapes, modelled as point sets, in a cardiac cycle. A deep recurrent encoder-decoder network captures the spatio-temporal dependencies to predict the next shape in the cycle. We demonstrate the versatility of the method using two shape datasets derived from: one million biventricular CMR images from 20,000 participants in the UK Biobank.

We present a massive investigation into the genetic basis of human lifespan. We mapped six genome-wide significant loci associated with parental lifespan. By combining the  AncestryDNA results with those of an independent UK Biobank dataset we identified fifteen parental lifespan-associated loci.

Obesity has been consistently associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk, but this relationship is weaker among women. In the UK Biobank, we investigated the associations between body size (body mass index [BMI], height, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) and body fat composition.

The role of growth factors and inflammation in the onset of glioma is poorly understood. We examined associations between C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the UK Biobank cohort.

The nature and underlying mechanisms of the observed increased vulnerability to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women are unclear. We investigated the genetic overlap of PTSD with anthropometric traits and reproductive behaviors and functions in women. The top association was related to BMI-adjusted waist circumference.

Exome sequencing identified a rare (minor allele frequency 0.0023) mutation in SMAD9 segregating with HBM in this autosomal dominant family. Affected individuals have bone mineral density (BMD) Z-scores +3 to +5, mandible enlargement, a broad frame, torus palatinus/mandibularis, pes planus, increased shoe size, and a tendency to sink when swimming.

In recent years, conditional and joint multiple-SNP analysis (GCTA-COJO) has been successful in allowing the discovery of additional association signals within detected loci. This suggests that many loci mapped in GWASs harbor more than a single causal variant. In order to interpret the underlying mechanism regulating a complex trait of interest in each discovered locus, researchers must assess the magnitude of allelic heterogeneity within the locus.

Single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic risk scores (GRS) model genetic risk as a continuum and can discriminate coeliac disease. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ gene testing is available in clinic but does not include non-HLA attributed risk and is limited by discrete risk stratification.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common gastrointestinal condition of poorly understood pathophysiology. While symptoms' overlap with other conditions may indicate common pathogenetic mechanisms, genetic predisposition is suspected but has not been adequately investigated. We surveyed FD comorbidities, heritability, and genetic correlations across a wide spectrum of conditions and traits.

Study looked for interaction effects between well-established environmental risk factors and common genetic variants exerting main effects on colorectal cancer risk. Seventy of the 1,500 tested interactions were nominally significant in phase I. After testing these 70 interactions in phase II, an interaction between rs11903757 (2q32.3) and body mass index (BMI) was nominallysignificant ( P  = 0.02)

We introduce a method for training neural networks to perform image or volume segmentation. Prior knowledge about the topology of the segmented object can be explicitly provided and then incorporated into the training process. We find that embedding explicit prior knowledge in neural network segmentation tasks is most beneficial when the task is especially challenging.

Uterine fibroids affect up to 77% of women by menopause and account for up to $34 billion in healthcare costs each year. Although fibroid risk is heritable, genetic risk is not well understood. We conducted a two-stage case-control meta-analysis of genetic variants in European and African ancestry women.

Plasma lipids are known heritable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence also supports shared genetics with diseases of other organ systems. We devised a comprehensive three-phase framework to identify new lipid-associated genes.

Familial relatedness (FR) and population structure (PS) are two major sources for genetic correlation. In the human population, both FR and PS can further break down into additive and dominant components. This study introduces a dominant genomic relationship matrix. A unified linear mixed model is also developed, which can account for both the additive and dominance effects.

Colorectal cancer risk stratification is crucial to improve screening and risk-reducing recommendations. Current screening guidelines in the UK, USA and Australia focus solely on family history. We investigated adding a polygenic risk score based on 45 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to a family history model.

Study looked at brain white matter microstructural differences associated with normotension, pre-hypertension and hypertension. 4659 participants without known neurological or psychiatric disease (62.3+/-7.4 yrs, 47.0% male) in UK Biobank. Brain white matter intracellular volume fraction was significantly lower in hypertensive individuals.

Study: ABO gene, chr 9q34.2, which determines blood type, may affect COVID-19 disease severity. Danish study identified ABO blood group as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection but not for hospitalization or death.

Brain structure in later life reflects both influences of intrinsic aging and those of lifestyle, environment and disease. We developed a deep neural network model trained on brain MRI scans to predict "healthy" brain age. Brain regions most informative for the prediction included the cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala and insular cortex.

Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) However, uncertainty exists on whether the inverse relationship between PA and incidence of CVD is greater at the highest levels of PA. We investigated the association between accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and total PA and incident CVD in the UK Biobank cohort.

106,053 UK Biobank participants wore a wrist-worn GENEactiv monitor. Men and women with the worst cardio-metabolic disease perform around half of moderate to vigorous physical activity on a daily basis compared to healthy individuals.

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated novel approaches and collaborative efforts across multiple disciplines. Circadian biology may inform our diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in this pandemic.

Accurate construction of polygenic scores (PGS) can enable early diagnosis of diseases and facilitate the development of personalized medicine. Accurate PGS construction requires prediction models that are both adaptive to different genetic architectures and scalable to biobank scale datasets. Here, we develop a method called Deterministic Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model.

Deep learning has huge potential for accurate disease prediction with neuroimaging data. But prediction performance is often limited by training-dataset size and computing memory requirements. To address this, we propose a deep convolutional neural network model, Simple Fully Convolutional Network (SFCN), for accurate prediction of brain age.

 SNP-heritability is a fundamental quantity in the study of complex traits. It remains unclear which estimates reported in the literature are reliable. We show that genome-wide SNP-Heritability can be accurately estimated from biobank-scale data irrespective of genetic architecture.

ShAPEIT4 substantially improves upon other methods to process large genotype and high coverage sequencing datasets. It notably exhibits sub-linear running times with sample size, provides highly accurate haplotypes and allows integrating external phasing information.

ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. A genetic risk score (GRS) underpinning lower ACE concentration was then tested for association. Genetically lower ACE concentrations were associated with a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Tobacco smoking is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study investigated the effects of smoking using a nested matched case-control study design. 5,668 participants of the UK Biobank study who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging were screened for inclusion.

This retrospective longitudinal study included 58,897 UK Biobank participants tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and February 2021. The hospital admission rate was 57% higher in the obese group with periodontal disease than without. The results could inform health providers, policy makers, and the general public of the importance to maintain good oral health.

Study included 283,443 adults from UK Biobank without CVD and cancer at baseline. One point increase of the healthy sleep score was associated with a 4-11% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Those with a favourable sleep pattern had 24-42% lower risks.

International dietary guidelines aim to reduce risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and fatal CVD often associated with poor dietary habits. Most studies have examined associations with individual nutrients, foods, or dietary patterns, as opposed to quantifying the pooled health effects of adherence to international dietary recommendations. We investigated associations between total adherence to the World Health Organization (WHO) dietary recommendations for saturated fats, free sugars, fibre, and fruits and vegetables.

Body size is an important modifiable risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. It remains unclear whether direct measures of fat mass are better indicators of risk than anthropometric measures. We analyzed data from 162,691 women in UK Biobank followed from 2006 to 2014.

We used information from 321,472 participants in the UK biobank, including 30,561 cases of obesity-related cancer. We looked at associations with 14 types of cancer, previously suggested to be associated with obesity. All genetic instruments had a strong association with BMI (p)

Study aimed to determine longitudinal associations of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and grip strength (GS) with objectively measured PA. Data are from the UK Biobank study.

Analysis included 153,139 adults from the UK Biobank, aged 40 to 70 years at baseline (2006-2010) Cataract was ascertained using hospital inpatient, and self-reported data until 2021. Anthropometric measures, body fat percentage, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured at baseline.

The obesity paradox in which overweight/obesity is associated with mortality benefits is believed to be explained by confounding and reverse causality rather than by a genuine clinical benefit of excess body weight. We aimed to gain deeper insights into the paradox through analyzing mortality relationships with several adiposity measures. We assessed subgroups with type 2 diabetes, with coronary heart disease (CHD), with cancer, and by smoking status.

Adult height is associated with risk of a range of diseases, but the breadth of such associations and whether these associations are primary or due to confounding are unclear. We examined the association of adult height with 50 diseases using both epidemiological and genetic approaches to identify un-confounded associations and possible underlying mechanisms.

Neurocognitive impairment is a common complication of congenital heart disease (CHD) as well as acquired cardiovascular disease. Data are limited on neurocognitive function in adults with CHD (ACHD) Individuals with ACHD had significantly poorer performance on alpha-numeric trail making, a measure of visual attention and cognitive flexibility. These differences appear to be driven by increased burden of cerebro- and cardiovascular disease among individuals with A CHD.

Low platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, is a common haematological abnormality. It can be acquired or hereditary and indicative of a complex disorder. We review how large cohorts, such as the UK Biobank and INTERVAL studies, have enabled an accurate description of platelet parameters in adult populations.

The UK Biobank Exome Sequencing Consortium (UKB-ESC) is a private-public partnership. It will complete the sequencing of exomes for all ~500,000 UKB participants. As a result, exome data from 200,643 UKB enrollees are now available.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects older people. Observational studies suggest indolent cardiovascular involvement after recovery from acute CO VID-19. However, these findings may reflect pre-existing cardiac phenotypes. We tested the association of baseline cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phenotypes with incident COVID- 19.

Shiftwork is an emerging social factor that contributes to disease in the urban environment across the working population. Studies have linked shiftwork to obesity and diabetes in nurses and industry workers. Little is known about the implications of shiftwork for the general workforce.

Adverse muscle composition (MC) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging has previously been linked to poor function, comorbidity, and increased hospitalization. The aim of this study was to investigate if adverse MC predicts all-cause mortality using data from UK Biobank.

Age-related cognitive decline is a well-known phenomenon after age 65. Little is known about earlier changes and prior studies are based on relatively small samples. We investigated the impact of age on cognitive decline in the largest population sample to date.

A comprehensive characterization of the brain's white matter is critical for improving our understanding of healthy and diseased aging. Here we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to estimate age and sex effects on white matter microstructure in a cross-sectional sample of 15,628 adults aged 45-80 years old.

APOE genotypes are associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD), several other cardiovascular diseases and dementia. Previous studies have not comprehensively considered all genotypes. In the UK Biobank, including 391,992 white British participants, we compared effects of APOE genotype on IHD and its risk factors.

Previous studies have shown an increased risk for mental health problems in children born to both younger and older parents. We previously used a novel design to reveal a latent mechanism of genetic association between schizophrenia and age at first birth in women (AFB) Here, we use independent data from the UK Biobank (N = 38,892) to replicate the finding of an association between predicted genetic risk of schizophrenia and AFB in women.

Mendelian randomization (MR) technique is not limited by traditional confounding. MR uses genetic variants as instruments under the assumption that they act on BMI only through age at menarche (no pleiotropy) MR-Egger regression did not suggest directional bias.

A trend towards earlier menarche in women has been associated with childhood factors (e.g. obesity) and hypothesised environmental exposures. We used Mendelian randomization where genetic variants are used as proxies for age atMenarche. In adult women, in line with previous evidence, we found an effect on restrictive lung impairment with a 24.8 mL increase in FVC per year increase in age.

It is unclear if puberty timing influences future physical activity (PA) Data were from two British cohorts. Per 1-year older age at menarche, PA was associated with higher mean counts/minute at age 14 years. associations attenuated at age 16 years.

Phenotypic biomarkers (e.g. cholesterol, weight, and glucose) are important to diagnose and treat diseases associated with aging. While many biomarkers are co-dependent, it is generally unknown how age influences their co-dependence. In the following, we analyzed 50 biomarkers in 27,508 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants.

Quantifying the microstructural properties of the human brain's connections is necessary for understanding normal ageing and disease. Here we examine brain white matter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 3,513 generally healthy people aged 44.64-77.12 years from the UK Biobank.

The aim of this study was to identify genetic risk variants associated with the age at which symptoms of allergic disease first develop. Self-reported age-of-onset information was available for 117,130 genotyped individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank study.

Study examined age-differences in surface-based morphometric measures of cortical thickness, volume, and surface area in a well-defined sample of 8137 generally healthy UK Biobank participants aged 45-79 years. Age of about 60 is a break point for increasing negative associations between age and brain morphology.

Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to lung cancer, but the degree to which air pollution modifies the impact of genetic susceptibility on lung cancer remains unknown. We analyzed data from 455,974 participants (53% women) without previous cancer at baseline in the UK Biobank. The results showed significant associations between the risk of lung cancer and PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2 and NO x.

We used Mendelian randomization to explore causal relationships between the degree of alcohol consumption and several cardiometabolic traits in the UK Biobank. We found that one additional drink of alcohol per day was positively associated with systolic blood pressure, hemorrhagic stroke, and atrial fibrillation. Alcohol was also associated with all cardiovascular disease and all-cause death. Findings were generally null in replication with two-sample analyses.

UK Biobank is a UK-wide cohort of 502,655 people aged 40-69, recruited from National Health Service registrants between 2006-10. Type 2 diabetes is a key exposure and outcome. We developed algorithms to define prevalent and incident diabetes.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a growing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Coffee consumption has been linked with lower rates of CLD, but little is known about the effects of different coffee types. This study aimed to investigate associations of coffee consumption with chronic liver disease outcomes.

Using genetic scores for fasting plasma glucose (FPG GS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D GS), we investigated whether the fasting, 1-hour and 2-hour glucose thresholds from the WHO 2013 criteria for gestational diabetes (GDM) have different implications for genetic susceptibility to raised fasting glucose. We looked at women from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) and Atlantic Diabetes in Pregnancy (DIP) studies.

Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of purine metabolism that causes nephrolithiasis and progressive chronic kidney disease. The small number of reported cases indicates an extremely low prevalence. It has been suggested that missed diagnoses may play a role.

The genetic locus 3p21.31 has been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) The underlying pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. To identify intermediate traits associated with the 3p.31 locus, we first performed a phenome-wide association study.

Secondhand smoke exposure is a major public health risk that is especially harmful to the developing brain. It is unclear if early exposure affects brain structure during middle age and older adulthood. We hypothesized that PSE would be associated with cortical disruption in primary sensory areas compared to unexposed adults.

The apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 locus is a genetic risk factor for dementia. Carriers of the e4 allele may be more vulnerable to conditions that are independent risk factors for cognitive decline.

PM 10 or NO 2 higher by 10 &#181;g.m -3 was associated with 12.8% (95% CI 9.5-16.3%) and 1.9% ( 95% CI 1.1-2.8%) higher lifetime asthma prevalence, respectively. Noise exposure was not significantly associated with asthma prevalence.

Mitochondrial DNA variation in common diseases has been underexplored, partly due to a lack of genotype calling and quality-control procedures. We show correlations between nuclear and mitochondrial genomic structures within subpopulations of Great Britain. We establish a UK Biobank reference atlas of mtDNA-phenotype associations.

We have analysed 162 PRS (p -05 ) derived from GWAS and 551 heritable traits from the UK Biobank study (N = 334,398) Findings can be investigated using a web application.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology that can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. This has been extended to multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate effect of two or more exposures. We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis.

UK Biobank is a major prospective epidemiological study, including multimodal brain imaging, genetics and ongoing health outcomes. Previously, we published genome-wide associations of 3,144 brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with a discovery sample of 8,428 individuals. We now include the X chromosome and new classes of imaging- derived phenotypes.

Efforts to prevent depression have focused on a limited number of candidate factors. Using phenotypic and genomic data from over 100,000 UK Biobank participants, the authors sought to systematically screen and validate a wide range of potential modifiable factors for depression.

Polygenic risk score (PRS) has been shown to be predictive of disease risk such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) However, existing studies on genetic prediction for T2D only had limited predictive power. We proposed a new three-step filtering procedure, which aimed to include truly predictive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) into PRS model.

Up to 30% of people who test positive to SARS-CoV-2 will develop severe COVID-19 and require hospitalisation. Age, gender, and comorbidities are known to be risk factors but are generally considered independently without accurate knowledge of the magnitude of their effect on risk. We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe CO VID-19.

Few tools exist that can integrate the genome and exposome for complex trait analyses. We propose a linear mixed model approach to bridge this gap. We illustrate our approach using traits from the UK Biobank. The joint model explains substantially more phenotypic variance.

A growing body of evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory infections. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death overall.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many variants associated with complex traits, but identifying the causal gene(s) is a major challenge. We present an open resource that provides systematic fine mapping and gene prioritization across 133,441 published human GWAS loci. We identify 729 loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant.

Researchers continue to exclude participants of non-European ancestry in human genetics studies. This practice perpetuates existing research disparities and can lead to important and large effect size associations being missed. Here, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 31 serum and urine biomarker quantitative traits in African, East Asian, and South Asian ancestry UK Biobank participants.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a commonly used clinical tool that reflects cardiac excitability and disease. Many parameters are can be measured and with the improvement of methodology can now be quantified in an automated fashion, with accuracy and at scale. These measurements can be heritable and thus genome wide association studies inform the underpinning biological mechanisms.

Weighted burden analysis of rare variants was applied to exome sequenced UK Biobank subjects with hyperlipidaemia as the phenotype. There was a tendency for genes on the X chromosome to produce strongly negative SLPs, and this was found to be due to the fact that rare X chromosome variants were identified less frequently in men than women.

Genetic background strongly influenced both baseline refractive development and susceptibility to environmentally-induced myopia. Baseline refractive errors ranged from - 21.2 diopters (D) in 129S1/svlmj mice to + 22.0 D in CAST/EiJ mice. Expression levels of 2,302 genes correlated with the baselineRefractive state of the eye, whereas 1,917 genes. correlated with susceptibility to induced myopia, including 847 genes implicated in the development of human myopia for first time.

Less than 3% of protein-coding genetic variants are predicted to result in loss of protein function. Such predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants provide insight into effector transcript and direction of biological effect. We identified 18 new low-frequency or rare (allele frequency) pLOF variants.

GIGYF1 has not previously been identified as a diabetes risk gene. Its product appears to be involved in the modification of insulin signalling. Loss of function (LOF) variants were associated with T2D in GCK and GIGyF1. nonsynonymous variants annotated as probably damaging were associated inGCK and HNF4A.

We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders.

Genotype-stratified variance of a quantitative trait could differ in the presence of gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Genetic markers associated with phenotypic variance are considered promising candidates for follow-up interaction or joint location-scale analyses. As males carry only one copy of the X-chromosome, the inherent sex-genotype dependency could bias the trait-genotypes association.

Chronic facial pain often overlaps with pain experienced elsewhere in the body. Previous studies have focused on a few, selected pain conditions when assessing the degree of overlap. Findings were replicated in the UK Biobank study and the US National Health Interview Survey.

Vitamin D has been shown to be beneficial at reducing the risk of cancer. Studies examining esophageal and gastric cancer have been scarce and findings inconsistent. The UK Biobank cohort was used for this nested case-control study (N = 3732)

The UK Biobank recruited &#8764;500,000 middle-aged participants throughout the United Kingdom in 2006-2010. Anthropometric indexes (height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body composition) and other physiologic characteristics (heel bone mineral density, grip strength, blood pressure, pulse rate) were measured. In white women, non-red meat eaters had lower adiposity (e.g., 4.5% lower body fat in vegan women) and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Obesity has been positively associated with upper gastrointestinal cancers. Obesity influences hormonal factors, which may play a role in these cancers. We examined anthropometry, body fat and reproductive factors in relation to oesophageal and gastric cancer by subtype/subsite in the UK Biobank cohort.

Apolipoprotein E &#949;4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) The Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane-40 (TOMM40) gene maintains cellular bioenergetics, which is disrupted in AD. TOMM40 '650 G versus A carriage is consistently related to neural and cognitive outcomes.

Coincident geographical variation in genotypes and health traits can bias these analyses. Understanding and accounting for this phenomenon will be important when making inference from genotype data in large studies.

People with obesity and a normal metabolic profile are sometimes referred to as having 'metabolically healthy obesity' (MHO) Whether this group of individuals are actually 'healthy' is uncertain. This study aims to examine the associations of MHO with a wide range of obesity-related outcomes.

We investigated a cohort from the MH - GRID (Minority Health Genomics and Translational Research Bio-Repository Database) and tested the association between ARMC 5 variants and blood pressure in black s. Sixteen rare variants were significantly associated with hypertension ( P=0.0402) in the gene-based (optimized sequenced kernel association test) analysis. The presence of the rs116201073 variant was associated with lower blood pressure.

Recent studies have demonstrated the important role played by gut microbiota in regulating bone development. The aim of this study is to assess the causal relationship from gut microbiota to bone development and to identify specific causal bacteria taxa. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistic based two-sample MR analysis was performed.

A major challenge for GWAS in population biobanks is ascertaining disease cases from heterogeneous data sources such as hospital records, digital questionnaire responses, or interviews. We find that hospital record and questionnaire GWAS largely identify similar genetic effects for many complex phenotypes and that combining together both phenotyping methods improves power to detect genetic associations.

 Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) has been associated with oral and oropharyngeal cancer risk but evidence is inconsistent. Five genetic variants reliably associated with circulating 25OHD were used to create a relative genetic measure of 25O HD. In the GAME-ON study, there was little evidence of a causal association between circulating 25 OHD and oral cancer.

Hyperuricemia is closely associated with insulin resistance syndrome. Whether these two conditions are causally related has long been debated. This study investigated the potential causal nature and direction of the relationship. Reducing insulin resistance could lower the SU level and gout risk, but not the other way around.

Cumulative evidence shows that gut microbiome can influence brain function and behavior via the inflammatory processes. However, the role of interaction between gut dysbiosis and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the development of anxiety and depression remains to be elucidated. In this study, 3321 independent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci associated with gut microbiome were driven from genome-wide association study.

The relationship between the genetic loci that influence mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and those associated with excess alcohol drinking is unknown. We used white British participants from the UK Biobank (n = 362 595) to assess the association between alcohol consumption and MCV. Increasing alcohol consumption by 40 g/week resulted in a 0.30% increase in MCV (P = 0.31)

More than 100,000 genetic variants are classified as disease causing in public databases. True penetrance of many of these rare alleles is uncertain and might be over-estimated by clinical ascertainment. We use data from 379,768 UK Biobank (UKB) participants of European ancestry to assess the pathogenicity of rare variants.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both common in older age and frequently co-occur. Both illnesses are polygenic, and shared genetic risk factors could explain some of the observed association. We used genotype data to test whether MDD and AD have an overlapping polygenic architecture.

We included 380 997 participants who had serum IGF1 measurement and no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), or diabetes at baseline.

Previous studies have suggested that coffee intake may be associated with a reduction in cancer risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies can help clarify whether the observed associations are likely to be causal.

 asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases throughout all age groups. We examined the causal effects of various environmental factors on asthma using Mendelian randomization. We found that BMI causally affects the development of asthma and that the adult-onset moderate-to-severe asthma subtype is the most susceptible to causal inference.

The prefrontal cortex is vulnerable to environmental insult. Among other factors, toxins in air pollution have been associated with damage to the prefrontal cortex in children and older adults. We used data from the UK Biobank to assess further associations between an array of toxins and gray matter.

Total brain gray-matter and white-matter volumes can be indicators of overall brain health. We found significant inverse associations between PM 2.5 concentration and total white- Matter volume. If replicated, these findings suggest that air pollution could be a risk factor for neurodegeneration.

From the UK Biobank cohort, 470 804 participants with fish oil supplementation data were included. A higher risk of breast cancer was observed in participants who consumed fatty fish at least two times per week. Findings underscore the need to refine recommendations for nutritional supplements according to inherent diet habits.

Median age of antioxidants users and non-users at baseline was 57 years. During 3.9 million person-years and a median follow-up of 11.5 years, 19,491 deaths occurred.

Lipid management typically focuses on levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and, to a lesser extent, triglycerides ( TG) However, animal models and genetic studies suggest that the atherogenic particle subpopulations are both important. The number of particles is more predictive of cardiac events than their lipid content.

Body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference are strongly correlated and do not reflect body composition. We examined differences in body composition between body-shape phenotypes defined with ABSI and HI. We used data from the UK Biobank Resource for 15,520 men, 16,548 women with dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements.

Data was from 147,478 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) and 2,905 from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured in both cohorts and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in NESDA. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with self-report questionnaires. Inflammation was associated with core depressive symptoms of low mood and anhedonia. Less consistent associations were found for anxiety.

Spending more time active is associated with health benefits such as improved cardiovascular health and lower risk of all-cause mortality. It is unclear whether these associations differ depending on whether time spent sedentary or in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is accumulated in long or short bouts. In this study, we used a novel method that accounts for substitution (i.e., more time in MVPA means less time sleeping, in light activity or sedentary) to examine whether length of sedentary and MVPA bouts associates with all- Cause mortality.

Major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are common, disabling and heritable psychiatric diseases with a complex overlapping polygenic architecture. Individuals with these disorders, as well as their unaffected relatives, show widespread structural differences in corticostriatal and limbic networks. Structural variation in many of these brain regions is also heritable and polygenic.

Dietary data was collected using a 24-h online dietary assessment on two or more occasions (n = 116,806) Two dietary patterns were retained that jointly explained 63% of variation in energy density, free sugars, saturated fat, and fiber intakes. The main dietary pattern was characterized by high intakes of chocolate and confectionery, butter and low-fiber bread.

The built environment might be associated with development of obesity and related disorders. We examined whether neighbourhood exposure to fast-food outlets and physical activity facilities were associated with adiposity in UK adults. Greater density of facilities within 1000 m of home was independently associated with smaller waist circumference and lower BMI and body fat percentage. Living further from a fast- food outlet was weakly associated with waist circumference.

Major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BD) have both shared and discrete genetic risk factors. The relationships between such genetic architectures and blood-based markers are, however, unclear. We investigated relationships between polygenic risk scores (PRS) for these disorders and peripheral markers in the UK Biobank cohort.

The "healthy obese" hypothesis suggests the risks associated with excess adiposity are reduced in those with higher muscle quality. Alternative possibilities include loss of muscle quality as people become unwell (reverse causality) or unmeasured confounding. We conducted a cohort study using the UK Biobank (n=452 931) Baseline body mass index ( BMI) was used to quantify adiposity and handgrip strength ( HGS ) used for musclequality. Low genetically predicted HGS was associated with an increased risk of mortality.

Multimorbidity is common among breast cancer survivors, with 32.9% of women experiencing one and 30.1% experiencing two or more chronic health conditions. Hypertension (25.8%), painful conditions (18.3%), and asthma (11.6%) were the three most common co-morbid conditions. 5.3% of participants had current depression.

Seventy-seven occupations were associated with level of alcohol consumption in drinkers. The largest ratios for heavy drinkers were observed for publicans and managers of licenced premises. Clergy, physicists, geologists and meteorologists were least likely to be heavy drinkers. There was evidence of gender-specific outcomes with the proportion of jobs associated with heavy drinking accounted for by skilled trade occupations.

Baseline data were available for 502,643 participants (2006-2010, United Kingdom) Cognitive tests included prospective memory, visual-spatial memory, fluid intelligence, and short-term numeric memory.

Smoking accelerates the ageing of multiple organs. Few studies have quantified the association between smoking, especially smoking cessation, and brain ageing. A brain age predictor was trained using a machine learning technique in the non-smoker group and then tested in the smoker group. On average, smokers showed a larger BrainAge Gap (+0.304 years, Cohens'd = 0.083) than controls.

There is limited evidence on associations between multiple vascular risk factors (VRFs) and detailed aspects of brain macrostructure and microstructure. Smoking, hypertension, pulse pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio were examined. A larger number of VRFs was associated with greater brain atrophy, lower grey matter volume, and poorer white matter health.

In many species, the offspring of related parents suffer reduced reproductive success, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that FROH is significantly associated (p)

Between 2006 and 2010, a total of 354,976 participants (age 40-70 years) in the UK Biobank free of stroke and coronary heart disease were examined and thereafter followed up to 2020. The risk of stroke decreased significantly and linearly with both increasing behavioral CVH score and biological CVH Score.

A total of 499,159 participants were recruited from the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010. Severe ISH was based on hospital inpatient records or a death cause of ICD-10 codes X60-X84. Sleep phenotypes, including sleep duration, chronotype, insomnia, sleepiness, and napping, were assessed at the initial assessments.

Vitamin D has numerous anticancer functions, but associations between vitamin D status and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and survival remain inconclusive. Based on UK Biobank, we prospectively evaluated the associations of season-standardized 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations with CRC risk. The highest quartile was associated with a 13% (HR, 0.87) lower risk of CRC.

Study looked at associations of physical and demographic factors with Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg) and corneal-compensated intraocular Pressure (Iopcc) in a British cohort. IOPg and IOPcc were both significantly associated with older age, male sex, higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), faster heart rate, greater myopia, self-reported glaucoma, and colder season.

Spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) provides high resolution images enabling identification of individual retinal layers. SD OCT measured photoreceptor layer thickness: inner nuclear layer-retinal pigment epithelium (INL-RPE) In multivariate regression models, the total average INL- RPE was observed to be thinner in older aged, females, Black ethnicity, smokers, participants with higher systolic blood pressure, more negative refractive error.

Spousal comparisons have been proposed as a design that can both reduce confounding and estimate effects of the shared adulthood environment. Assortative mating could distort associations when comparing spouses. Analyses using UK Biobank spouse pairs found that WSP genetic association estimates were smaller than estimates from random pairs for height, educational attainment, and BMI.

The trend towards large-scale studies including population imaging poses new challenges in terms of quality control (QC) This is a particular issue when automatic processing tools such as image segmentation methods are employed. Manual inspection and visual QC of each segmentation result is not feasible at large scale.

Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) may represent a novel risk marker for cardiovascular disease. We developed a fully automated quality-controlled tool for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) PAT quantification in the UK Biobank. Larger CMR PAT area was associated with significantly greater odds of diabetes independent of age, sex and body mass index.

Morphological changes in the retinal vascular network are associated with future risk of many systemic and vascular diseases. Analysis of data from large population based studies will help to resolve these uncertainties. A random subset of 800 retinal images from UK Biobank (a large prospective study of 500,000 middle aged adults; where 68,151 underwent retinal imaging) was used to examine the performance of the image quality algorithm.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images play a growing role in the diagnostic imaging of cardiovascular diseases. Full coverage of the left ventricle (LV), from base to apex, is a basic criterion for CMR image quality. A two-stage framework is proposed to identify missing basal and apical slices in measurements of CMR volume.

Good quality of medical images is a prerequisite for the success of subsequent image analysis pipelines. For large population studies such as the UK Biobank, manual identification of artefacts such as those caused by unanticipated motion is tedious and time-consuming. We propose a method to automatically detect the presence of motion-related artefacts in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images.

Estimates from Mendelian randomization studies of unrelated individuals can be biased due to uncontrolled confounding from familial effects. We show that family-based analyses can reduce such biases. We illustrate how familial effects can affect estimates using data from 61,008 siblings from the Nord-Tr&#248;ndelag Health Study.

SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic. Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS- cov-2. Higher BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased odds. Elevated HDL-C and ApoA-I levels associated with reduced odds.

Vitamin D has been associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the results are inconsistent. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D metabolism is linked to sleep behaviors. We investigated the prospective association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and risk of incident T2D.

Gil McVean and colleagues present a new Bayesian analysis framework that exploits the hierarchical structure of diagnosis classifications. Their method displays increased power to detect genetic effects over other approaches and identifies novel associations between classical HLA alleles and common immune-mediated diseases.

The enormous variation in human lifespan is in part due to a myriad of sequence variants, only a few of which have been revealed to date. Since many life-shortening events are related to diseases, we developed a Mendelian randomization-based method combining 58 disease-related GWA studies to derive longevity priors for all HapMap SNPs.

We created a suite of packages to enable analysis of extremely large genomic data sets. The package is accessible through CRAN and GitHub. In this note, we describe the classes and methods implemented in each of the packages that make the suite.

Major depressive disorder is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder, affecting 11% of veterans. We report results of a large meta-analysis of depression using data from the Million Veteran Program, 23andMe, UK Biobank and FinnGen. Transcriptome-wide association study analyses revealed significant associations with expression of NEGR1 and DRD2.

Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) allows the use of summary association results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) Some GWAS adjust for heritable covariables in an attempt to estimate direct effects of genetic variants on the trait of interest. In the absence of residual confounding, using covariable-adjusted summary associations for two-sample MR eliminated bias.

The relationship between physical activity and muscular strength has not been examined in detail among older adults. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between physical. activity and hand grip strength among adults aged 60 years and older.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) gene indicate the second highest odds-ratios for sporadic AD. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 genotype, which increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), predicted severe COVID-19 infection in one UK Biobank (UKB) cohort.

Until recently, pharmacogenes could not be studied at biobank scale. In EUR, N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) metabolizer phenotype and activity score were associated with simvastatin use. Testing NAT2 alleles may be useful for making clinical decisions regarding the potential benefit of statin treatment.

The tendency to conceive spontaneous dizygotic twins is a complex trait with important contributions from both environmental factors and genetic disposition. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants influencing multiple births and to genetically correlate the findings across a broad range of traits.

UK Biobank recruited 500,000 participants aged 40-69 y (54.4% women) throughout the United Kingdom in 2006-2010. Blood and urine were collected at recruitment and assayed for more than 30 biomarkers related to cardiovascular diseases, bone and joint health, cancer, diabetes, renal disease, and liver health.

Study aimed to characterize the biomarker profile of sarcopenic vs nonsarcopenic men and women. Thirty-three biomarkers, standardized to sex-specific z-scores, were included in the analysis. Sarcopenia was associated with higher concentrations of phosphate, lipoprotein A, and lower of diastolic blood pressure.

The UK Biobank study has successfully imaged more than 32,000 volunteer participants with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Each scan is linked to extensive metadata, providing a comprehensive medical survey of imaged anatomy and related health states.

The risk for hypertension decreased as birth weight increased up to approximately 3.80 kg. Compared with the participants with the fourth quintile of birth weight, those with the first quartile had the highest risk. These associations were largely consistent in the stratified and sensitivity analyses. Our findings indicate that lower birth weight is nonlinearly correlated with higher risk of hypertension.

The relationship between birth weight and osteoporosis was inconsistent in previous observational studies. We performed a systematic evaluation to determine the inconsistent relationship and further make causal inference based on the UK Biobank datasets. Birth weight was causally associated not only with three BMD phenotypes but also with the risk of fracture using different Mendelian randomization methods.

Fetal intrauterine growth is influenced by complex interactions between the maternal genes, environment and fetal genes. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of GWAS-identified genetic variants associated with birth weight on fetal growth in 665 children.

Medical research increasingly includes high-dimensional regression modeling with a need for error-in-variables methods. The Convex Conditioned Lasso (CoCoLasso) utilizes a reformulated Lasso objective function and an error-corrected cross-validation. We develop a Block coordinate Descent ConveX Conditioning Lasso. This algorithm separately optimizes the estimation of the uncorrupted and corrupted features.

The association between blood pressure (BP) and bladder cancer (BC) risk remains unclear with confounding by smoking being of particular concern. We found a positive association between systolic BP and BC risk in Swedish cohorts. BP levels were positively associated with muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) but not with non-muscle invasive BC, which could be analyzed in the Swedish cohorts only.

Figure 1 shows the size of the human body. Figure 1: The human body is made up of more than 100 million cells. Figure 2: The number of human cells is estimated to be around 100 million.

Hypertension or elevated blood pressure (BP) is an important risk factor for aortic dissection (AD) Few prospective studies on this topic have been published. We investigated the association between hypertension/elevated BP and AD in 2 cohorts.

Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is a proxy for mitochondrial function and is associated with aging-related diseases. It is unclear how mtDNA- CN measured in blood can reflect diseases that primarily manifest in other tissues. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, we interrogated relationships between mt DNA-CN measured in whole blood and gene expression in 47 additional tissues.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a modifiable risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) We tested whether the association between BP and risk of AF is causal, and whether it varies according to individual's genetic susceptibility for AF. We also tested the extent to which specific BP-lowering drugs are expected to reduce this risk.

The recognition of adiposity as a risk factor for gastric cancer is mainly based on traditional anthropometric indices, such as body mass index. We undertook this study to examine body composition and subsequent risk of Gastric cancer. We documented 326 cases of cancer from 474,929 participants over a median follow-up of 6.6 years.

The UK Biobank measured baseline body composition and confirmed cancer diagnosis. For premenopausal women, whole body fat-free mass (WBFFM) was associated with an increased risk of uterine corpus cancer. No association of body composition with ovarian or cervical cancer was observed.

Study aimed to investigate the value of imaging-based multivariable body composition profiling by describing its association with coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic health on individual and population levels.

Study aimed to quantify associations of regional fat mass and fat-free mass with systolic blood pressure. Among 10,260 participants (mean age 49; 96% white), systolic blood pressure was positively associated with visceral android fat. There was no evidence of an association with subcutaneous android or gynoid fat.

Study looked at the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality. An increase of 1 unit in genetically predicted BMI led to a 5% (95% confidence interval 1% to 8%) higher risk of mortality in overweight participants. But a 34% (16% to 48%) lower risk in underweight participants.

Evidence for the impact of body size and composition on cancer risk is limited. This mendelian randomisation study investigates evidence supporting causal relationships of body mass index, fat mass index and fat-free mass index with cancer risk.

We investigated associations between body size and composition, physical activity and sedentary time and serum concentrations of oestradiol (premenopausal women only), testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in UK Biobank. In premenopausal women, higher BMI was associated with a lower concentration of total ostradiol and a higher concentration of SHBG.

Predicting a person's age using brain features can aid the detection of abnormalities in the ageing process. Existing studies on such "brain age prediction" vary widely in terms of their methods and type of data.

Brain imaging can be used to study how individuals' brains are aging, compared against population norms. This can inform on aspects of brain health; for example, smoking and blood pressure can be seen to accelerate brain aging.

Between-individual variability in brain structure is determined by gene-environment interactions. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed thinner cortices and smaller subcortical volumes in patients with schizophrenia. Group-level comparisons may mask considerable within-group heterogeneity, which has largely remained unnoticed in the literature.

Seasonal differences in mood and depressive symptoms affect a large percentage of the general population. SAD affects up to 3% of the world's population, and it tends to be more predominant in females than males. The brainstem has been shown to be affected by photoperiodic changes. Longer Photoperiod days are associated with larger brainstem volumes and lower depressive scores.

A previous genome-wide association study found three genetic loci to increase the risk of Brugada Syndrome (BrS) Since the effect of these loci in the general population is unknown, we aimed to investigate the effect on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and outcomes. A cohort of 6,161 individuals with available digital ECGs was genotyped and followed for a median period of 13 [IQR 12.6-13.4] years. Data on outcomes were collected from Danish administrative healthcare registries.

Cross-sectional studies of carotid artery atherosclerosis in 24,822 Chinese adults from the China Kadoorie Biobank and 2579 Europeans from the UK Biobanks. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years) Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age.

Cam morphology was more prevalent in males than females (15.4% and 1.8% respectively) In males, cam morphology was associated with rHOA [OR 3.20 (95% CI 2.41-4.25)], JSN [1.53 (1.24-1.88)], and acetabular dysplasia (AD) Neither pincer morphology nor AD showed any associations with hip pain.

COVID-19 is a disease that has shown to have outcomes that vary by certain socio-demographic and socio-economic groups. It is increasingly important that an understanding of these outcomes should be derived not from the consideration of one aspect, but by a more multi-faceted understanding of the individual.

"Deep learning" (DL) techniques such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have not been comprehensively tested. We analyzed a total of five phenotypes: height, bone heel mineral density, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and waist-hip ratio. For height, a highly heritable phenotype, all methods performed similarly, although CNNs were slightly but consistently worse.

UK Biobank recruited 503,325 persons aged 40-69 years. Participants completed questionnaires, including pain, lifestyle and environment factors. Prevalence of chronic pain and most regional musculoskeletal pains were all within 2% of that in NCDS.

Cannabis is known to produce acute, transient psychotic-like experiences. It is unclear whether cannabis disproportionately increases the risk of specific types of psychotic experiences and whether genetic predisposition influences the relationship between cannabis use and psychotic experiences. In this cross-sectional study of 109,308 UK Biobank participants, we examined how schizophrenia polygenic risk modulates the association between self-reported cannabis use.

There were significant associations between mood disorder features and 'any cardiovascular disease' Individuals with features of mood disorder taking psychotropic medication were significantly more likely than controls not on psychotropics to report myocardial infarction. Psychotropic medication may also be a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease.

High VAT-high LF and high VAT-low LF were associated with prevalent atherosclerosis. Low VAT- high LF was not. In the UK Biobank, only high VAT -low LF remained associated with CVD after multivariable adjustment.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with mortality and cardiovascular disease. We develop and validate a novel framework to estimate CRF from heart rate response to low-risk personalised exercise tests. We apply the method to examine associations between CRF and health outcomes.

About 4% of the study population were diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory disorder. The most common inflammatory disorder was psoriasis, and the least common was SLE (n=654). SLE showed the strongest association with multiple (relative risk) risk of cardiometabolic diseases.

Risk prediction models currently recommended by clinical guidelines are typically based on a limited number of predictors with sub-optimal performance across all patient groups. Data-driven techniques based on machine learning might improve the performance of risk predictions by agnostically discovering novel risk predictors and learning the complex interactions between them.

5065 consecutive UK Biobank participants underwent CMR using cine balanced steady-state free precession imaging at 1.5 T. With advancing age, end-diastolic TA diameter became larger and posterior MV leaflet angle smaller in both sexes.

Population-based, case-control study investigated cardiovascular risk factors and body composition in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia. Participants had lower age-adjusted mean blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with controls.

It is uncertain to what extent established cardiovascular risk factors are associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) This study included individual participant data mostly from essentially population-based cohort studies from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration and the UK Biobank. Older age, smoking, and adiposity were consistently associated with higher VTE risk.

Excessive coffee consumption can lead to unpleasant sensations such as tachycardia and heart palpitations. We used information from up to 390,435 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank, aged 39-73 y. Participants with essential hypertension, angina, or heart arrhythmia were more likely to drink less caffeinated coffee.

There was a distinct increase in the number of CVD-related deaths in the UK Biobank population at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The shortage of medical resources for hospital care and stress reactions to the pandemic might have partially contributed to the excess mortality.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be a powerful tool for detecting global patterns of interaction. We show how a linear regression of the PRS on E in a sample of cases can be used to efficiently estimate the interaction parameter. We applied the proposed method to investigate interactions between a PRS and epidemiologic factors on breast cancer risk in the UK Biobank.

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to investigate the associations between genetic predisposition to thyroid dysfunction and 22 site-specific cancers. Genetically predicted thyroid dysfunction was associated with breast cancer, with similar patterns of associations in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium and UK Biobank. The role of TSH and hypothyroidism for thyroid cancer needs further exploration.

Study was an observational cohort study investigating the UK Biobank. Lower alcohol use was observationally associated with a higher risk of prevalent CKD or incident ESKD. However, the genetic risk of CKD was significantly associated with lower alcohol use, suggesting reverse causation.

Gallstone disease (GSD) is associated with a higher risk of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. However, it is unclear whether the associations are causal.

Blood homocysteine level and related vitamin levels are associated with various health outcomes. We aimed to assess causal effects of blood homocy Steine, folate, and cobalamin on kidney function in the general population by performing Mendelian randomization analysis.

Physical activity and television watching affect kidney function in the general population. A higher degree of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with a higher eGFR. A longer time spent watching television was significantly associated with higher prevalence of CKD. The other sedentary behaviors yielded inconsistent results.

Genetic instruments for positive affect, life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism were introduced from a previous genome-wide association study meta-analysis of European individuals. In summary-level MR with the CKDGen data, depressive Symptoms were a significant causative factor for kidney function impairment. A genetic predisposition for positive Affect was significantly associated with better kidney function.

Study was an observational cohort study mainly based on the UK Biobank. Median relative macronutrient intake composition at baseline was 35% fats, 15% protein, and 50% carbohydrates. Higher relative protein intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of incident ESKD.

We aimed to investigate the causal effects of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Higher genetically predicted eicosapentaenoic acid and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid levels were significantly associated with a lower risk of CAD both in the allele-score-based and summary-level MR analyses.

Study comprised 1,211 European participants tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 387,079 participants who were either untested or tested negative between 16 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. Higher BMI, WC, HbA1c and lower HDL-cholesterol were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection.

As adult height is linked to various health outcomes, further investigation of its causal effects on kidney function later in life is warranted. This study involved a cross-sectional observational analysis and summary-level Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.

Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits.

We studied 493 280 UK residents enrolled in the UK Biobank cohort study. Of 27 729 deaths, 20.4% were primarily attributed to CVD, 53.6% to cancer and 5.0% to infection. As cardiovascular multimorbidity increased, the proportion of cardiovascular and infection-related deaths was greater.

The gastric epithelium is often exposed to injurious elements. Failure of appropriate healing predisposes to ulcers, hemorrhage, and ultimately cancer. CD36 expresses on corpus ECs, on PC basolateral membranes, and in gastrin and ghrelin cells.

Study followed 130,473 UK Biobank participants aged 60-69 y (baseline 2006-2010) for &#8804;8.3 y ( n  = 2974 deaths) Current smokers and individuals with recent or disease-associated weight loss were excluded, yielding a "healthier agers" group. Being overweight with a higher WHR was associated with substantial excess mortality.

Commuters were selected from the UK Biobank cohort if they completed assessment centre visits between 2006 and 2016. Participants were categorised as 'inactive' (car only) or 'active' commuters (any other mode(s), including walking, cycling and public transport). Transitions between categories were defined between pairs of visits.

Asthma is a complex disease that is reportedly associated with insomnia. However, the causal directionality of this association is still unclear. We used asthma and insomnia-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics.

Liver fat was able to be measured as the MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF) with an overall success rate of 96.4%. The overall hepatic fat distribution was centred between 1-2%, and was highly skewed towards higher fat content. The mean PDFF was 3.91%, and median 2.11%.

It is thought that alcohol intake and body mass index (BMI) interact supra-additively to modulate the risk of cirrhosis, but evidence for this phenomenon is limited. We investigated the interrelationship between alcohol and BMI on the incidence of Cirrhosis morbidity for participants of the United Kingdom Biobank study.

Characteristics of the environment influence health and may promote physical activity. We explored the associations between neighborhood environmental characteristics and physical activity in adults from UK Biobank. We found participants living in areas with higher concentrations of air pollution recorded and reported lower levels of physical activity and those in rural areas and more walkable areas had higher levels of activity.

Atypical depression (AD) characterized by reversed neurovegetative symptoms is associated with a more pernicious course and a different sociodemographic, lifestyle, and comorbidity profile. AD was associated with female gender, unhealthy behaviours, more lifetime deprivation and adversity, higher rates of psychiatric disorders and obesity.

The ABO gene contains three major alleles that encodes different antigens; A, B, and O, which determine an individual's blood group. Previous studies have primarily focused on identifying associations between ABO blood groups and diseases risk. Here, we sought to test for association between A BO genotypes and a large set of common inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases.

UK Biobank participants of White ethnicity aged 40-69 years old underwent autorefraction. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for myopia or high myopia associated with a diagnosis before age 17 years of each of nine febrile illnesses.

Higher childhood body mass index (BMI) has been associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) We examined whether childhood BMI has a causal influence on MS, and whether this putative effect is independent from early adult obesity and pubertal timing. Findings were replicated using the UK Biobank.

Autistic individuals experience significantly elevated rates of childhood trauma, self-harm and suicidal behaviour and ideation. Is this purely the result of negative environmental experiences, or does this interact with genetic predisposition? In this study we investigated if a genetic predis position for autism is associated with childhood trauma using polygenic scores.

Haematopoietic clones with acquired mutations become common with advancing age and can lead to blood cancers1-10. In this long-lived Japanese population, mosaic chromosomal alterations were detected in more than 35.0% (s.m., 1.4%) of individuals older than 90 years. Three different mutational precursors of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (including trisomy 12, loss of chromosomes 13q and 13q, and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) were between two and six times less common among Japanese individuals.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a non-atherosclerotic cause of myocardial infarction (MI) typically in young women. We undertook a genome-wide association study of SCAD (Ncases = 270/Ncontrols = 5,263) and identified an association of rs12740679 at chromosome 1q21.2.

Diurnal preference for evening time has been associated with increased odds for current depression and a number of indices of the disorder. Previous work has also suggested that larger hippocampal volume may be protective against depression.

The study sample was a subset of the UK Biobank Resource, 164,770 adults aged between 40 and 69 years. Hearing loss was defined as speech recognition in noise in the better ear poorer than 2 standard deviations below the mean. Current smokers were more likely to have a hearing loss than non-smokers. For both smoking and passive smoking, there was evidence of a dose-response effect.

Elevated CRP levels were associated with a 22% increased lung cancer risk per 1 SD increase. Positive associations were observed in small cell lung cancer. When added to a risk model of lung cancer, CRP improved the performance of model as long as 8 years among current smokers.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been implicated in several malignancies. Few studies have examined multiple cancers simultaneously. We conducted a prospective analysis between IGF-1 and incident total and 19 site-specific cancers among 412,645 individuals.

There is strong epidemiological evidence that circulating insulin-like growth factor-I is associated with a higher risk of several cancers. Little is known about its association with non-cancer outcomes. We investigated associations of circulating IGF-I with risk of 25 common conditions, other than cancer, in a large British cohort.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and testosterone have been implicated in prostate cancer aetiology. We investigated the associations of circulating IGF-I, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total and calculated free testosterone concentrations with prostate cancer incidence and mortality. For prospective analyses, risk was estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression in 199 698 male UK Biobank participants.

 Epidemiologic studies evaluating associations between sex steroid hormones and colorectal cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results. To elucidate the role of circulating levels of testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), we conducted observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. In the observational analysis, there was little evidence that total testosterone was associated with cancer risk.

Evidence is mixed on whether cholesterol plays a role in the pathogenesis of glioma. We explored the associations between circulating lipids and gli cancer risk in three prospective cohorts.

This study investigated the causal relation between circulating phylloquinone (vitamin K 1 ) concentrations and type 2 diabetes. We used data from three studies: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study, Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) and the UK Biobank.

Gastrointestinal cancers show an unexplained male predominance. Few prospective studies have investigated sex hormones and gastrointestinal cancer risk. This study aimed to determine the impact of circulating sex hormones on risk of esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers in men and women.

Circulating vitamin C concentrations have been associated with several cancers. Little is known about the causal direction of the associations. This study aims to explore the potential causal relationship between circulating vitamin C and risk of five most common cancers in Europe.

 Observational studies strongly supported the association of low levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and cognitive impairment or dementia in aging populations. However, randomized controlled trials have not shown clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation could improve cognitive outcomes.

Breast cancer is the most common solid organ malignancy and most frequent cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Previous research has yielded insights into its genetic etiology, but there remains a gap in the understanding of genetic factors that contribute to risk. National Cancer Institute's "Up for a Challenge" competition provided an opportunity to further elucidate the genetic basis of the disease.

Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence has been dramatically increasing worldwide. Psoralen, a known photocarcinogen, is naturally abundant in citrus products. High citrus consumption was not associated with an increased risk of NMSC in our UKBB sample.

High citrus consumption may increase melanoma risk. Little is known about the biological mechanisms of this association, or whether it is modified by genetic variants. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of gene-citrus consumption interactions.

Hearing relies on mechanically gated ion channels present in actin-rich stereocilia bundles at the apical surface of cochlear hair cells. Clrn2 clarinet/clarinet mice exhibit a progressive, early-onset hearing loss, with no overt retinal deficits.

Liver dysfunction, growth hormone and testosterone deficiency, innate immunity, anemia, macrocytosis, and insulin resistance were associated with MDD incidence in a large community-based cohort. All 30 significant associations with extreme laboratory test results were directionally consistent with an increased MDD risk.

Covid-19 has rapidly infected millions of people worldwide. Recent studies suggest that racial minorities and patients with comorbidities are at higher risk. In this study, we analyzed the effects of clinical, regional, and genetic factors on Covid- 19 positive status.

We sought to determine the relationship between age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) CH, defined as mosaic chromosome abnormalities (mCA) and/or driver mutations, was identified in 5449 (2.9%) eligible UK Biobank participants. CH was negatively associated with glomerular filtration rate estimated from cystatin-C (eGFR.cys; &#946; = -0.75, P = 2.37 Ã— 10-4)

There are few examples of robust associations between rare copy number variants (CNVs) and complex continuous human traits. We present a large-scale CNV association meta-analysis on anthropometric traits in up to 191,161 adult samples from 26 cohorts. The study reveals five CNV associations at 1q21.1, 3q29, 7q11.23, 11p14.2, and 18q 21.32. The discovered CNVs are recurrent and rare (0.01-0.2%), with large effects on height, weight, and body mass index.

Coffee and tea are the major contributors of caffeine in the diet. Evidence points to the premise that caffeine may benefit cognition. We examined the associations of habitual regular coffee or tea and caffeine intake with cognitive function whilst additionally accounting for genetic variation in caffeine metabolism.

UK Biobank captured self-reported coffee consumption and cancer-registry recorded incident digestive cancers. Risk of every type of digestive cancer was investigated in association with coffee consumption by dose-response and by coffee type.

This study examines the causal genetic associations between cognitive ability and physical health. BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes showed negative associations with cognitive ability. Higher educational attainment predicted lower BMI and higher blood pressure. The lack of evidence for causal associations could be explained by weak instrumental variables.

Rare copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. The effects of many individual CNVs in carriers without neuro developmental disorders are not yet fully understood.

The UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical resource, containing sociodemographic and medical information. We identified participants who either self-reported or were identified from a nurse-led interview, having suffered a stroke or a TIA. Hypertension, smoking, higher WHR, lower alcohol consumption and diabetes were all more common in people with cerebrovascular disease.

Collider bias can induce associations between two or more variables which affect the likelihood of an individual being sampled. The optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.

Previous studies using additive genetic models failed to identify robust evidence of associations between colorectal cancer risk variants and survival outcomes. Here, we tested all currently known CRC-risk variants in a discovery analysis of 5675 patients from a Scottish cohort. We found that the TT genotype of the intron variant rs7495132 in the CRTC3 gene was associated with poorer CRC-specific survival.

Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) are measures of general and central obesity, respectively. Both have been shown to be associated with cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence of their combined association with the risk of cancer.

Prostate cancer is known to have a strong genetic basis and is influenced by both common and rare variants. We conducted an investigation of 81 094 men from the UK Biobank, including 3568 prostate cancer cases. The absolute risk of prostate cancer for HOXB13, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 P/LP/D carriers ranged from 9% to 56%.

A genetic risk score (GRS) for fatty liver disease influences the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Three genetic variants were combined into a risk score ranging from 0 to 6 for risk-increasing alleles. A higher GRS was associated with an increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 26% in those with score 5 or 6.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a five-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke. Current risk stratification tools (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) do not include family history or genetic risk. We hypothesized that we could improve stroke prediction in patients with AF by incorporating polygenic risk scores.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) may soon be used to predict inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk in prevention efforts. We leveraged exome-sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data from 29,358 individuals in the multiethnic, randomly ascertained health system-based BioMe biobank. Lower predictive power for non-Europeans was observed.

Aspirin and ibuprofen have been reported to reduce the mortality rate. Omeprazole can increase mortality. The FDA has approved only one drug, remdesivir, for the treatment of COVID-19.

Diseases with the same onset profile are genetically more similar. This similarity was not explained by disease categories, co-occurrences or disease cause-effect relationships. Two of the four disease clusters had an increased risk of occurrence from ages 20 and 40.

A prolonged T-peak-to-Tend (Tpe) interval on the electrocardiogram is an independent predictor of increased arrhythmic risk. Tpe changes with heart rate are even stronger predictors. We identify 32 loci for resting Tpe and 3 for Tpe response to exercise and recovery. Sex-specific analyses indicated seven additional loci.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 190 loci associated with maternal or fetal effects on birth weight. Numerous monogenic developmental syndromes are associated with birth weights at the extreme ends of the distribution. We found birth weight GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fall closer to such genes than expected.

We analyzed the effects of the common BMI-increasing melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) rs17782313-C allele with a minor allele frequency of 0.22-0.25 on cardiovascular disease outcomes. We additionally analyzed whether potential associations were modified by sex or explained by changes in body mass index. We confirmed the BMI- Increasing effects of +0.22 kg/m 2 per additional copy of the C allele.

Drugs used for nervous system disorders were associated with poorer cognitive performance. Drugs used for non-nervous system conditions also showed significant negative association with cognitive score. Only a few medications and health supplements showed association towards a positive effect on cognitive function.

The National Health Service England classifies individuals as eligible for lung cancer screening using two risk prediction models, PLCOm2012 and Liverpool Lung Project-v2. No study has compared the performance of lung cancer risk models in the UK.

We developed a central processing and graphics processing unit (CPU and GPU) accelerated Fast and Powerful Heritability Inference (FPHI) approach that linearizes likelihood calculations. We calculated for 60 regional and 1.3 Ã— 10 5 voxel-wise traits in N = 1,206 twin and sibling participants from the Human Connectome Project.

Polygenic scores now explain approximately 10% of the variation in educational attainment. This is because of passive gene-environment correlation, whereby the correlation between offspring and parent genotypes results in an association between offspring genotypes and the rearing environment. Adoptees' genotypes were less correlated with their rearing environments because they did not share genes with their adoptive parents.

Accurate estimation of genetic correlation requires large sample sizes and access to genetically informative data, which are not always available. Cheverud's conjecture asserts that the use of phenotypic correlations as proxies for genetic correlations is appropriate. Empirical evidence of the conjecture has been found across plant and animal species.

The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) was developed toquantify brain similarity by comparing individual white matter microstructure, cortical gray matter thickness and subcortical gray matter structural volume measures. We tested the specificity of the RVI approach for major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)

The UK Biobank cohort is a population-based cohort of 500,000 participants recruited in the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis. At age 70-74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2% and 11.8% lower, respectively, in men and 55.1% lower in women.

Of UK Biobank participants included, 802 were admitted to hospital with and/or died from COVID19 (323 deaths and 479 hospitalisations) After analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, a higher risk of COVID-19 was observed for pre-frail and frail individuals compared to those classified as robust.

Population-based biobanks provide opportunities for generating effective therapeutic hypotheses and understanding the genomic role in disease predisposition. We apply truncated singular value decomposition (DeGAs) to matrices of summary statistics derived from genome-wide association analyses across 2,138 phenotypes measured in 337,199 White British individuals in the UK Biobank study. We systematically identify key components of genetic associations and contributions of variants, genes, and phenotypes.

Obesity is a major risk factor for a wide range of cardiometabolic diseases. The impact of specific aspects of body morphology remains poorly understood. We combined the GWAS summary statistics of fourteen anthropometric traits from UK Biobank through principal component analysis.

Multiple genes have been associated with monogenic Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism syndromes. Mutations in PINK1 (PARK6) have been shown to result in autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's Disease. In the past decade, several studies have suggested that carrying a single heterozygous Pink1 mutation is associated with increased risk for Parkinson's.

Circulating biomarkers have been previously associated with atherosclerosis-related risk factors, but the nature of these associations is incompletely understood. We found a total of 15, 9, 21, 22, 26, 24, and 26 biomarkers strongly associated with coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio.

Open-science and team-based scientific discovery offer hope for tackling some of the difficult challenges associated with managing, modeling, and interpreting of large, complex, and multisource data. Translating raw observations into useful information and actionable knowledge depends on effective domain-independent reproducibility, area-specific replicability, data curation, analysis protocols, and organization.

 REGENIE is a novel machine-learning method for fitting a whole-genome regression model. It is substantially faster than alternatives in multi-trait analyses while maintaining statistical efficiency. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of this approach using the UK Biobank dataset.

Jian Yang and colleagues explore the uses and abuses of heritability estimates derived from pedigrees and from GWAS SNPs. They make recommendations for best practice in future applications of SNP-based heritability.

Spatial Confidence Sets (CSs) on clusters found in thresholded Cohen's d effect size images. CSs convey information about magnitude and reliability of effect sizes that is usually given separately in a t-statistic and effect estimate map.

Dealing with confounds is an essential step in large cohort studies to address problems such as unexplained variance and spurious correlations. UK Biobank is a powerful resource for studying associations between imaging and non-imaging measures.

Previous studies have revealed the involvement of coffee and tea in the development of stroke and dementia. Little is known about the association between coffee/tea consumption and the risk of stroke, dementia, and poststroke dementia. This prospective cohort study included 365,682 participants from the UK Biobank.

Genomic contribution to adverse health sequelae in babies born very preterm. We studied 488 parent-offspring trios using Illumina Infinium OmniExpress Arrays. We identified 14 de novo CNVs, representing a mutation rate of 2.9%.

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has been suggested as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Yet the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models for VAT mass using the UK Biobank cohort. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

South Asians had a higher risk for CVD mortality (HR: 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89) and incidence, but a decreased risk for cancer mortality. Compared with individuals without T2D, both white Europeans and South Asians with T2d had aHigher risk for all-cause mortality (1.59) and CVD incidence and mortality.

Major depressive disorder emerges from the complex interactions of biological systems that span genes and molecules through cells, networks, and behavior. Establishing how neurobiological processes coalesce to contribute to depression requires a multiscale approach. We examine anatomical and functional correlates of depression and negative affect across three population-imaging datasets.

Classic LMMs assume independence between random effects, which can be violated, causing bias. We introduce a generalized GREML that explicitly estimates the covariance betweenRandom effects. CORE GREML outperforms the conventional GREML, providing variance estimates free from bias due to correlated random effects.

Hearing impairment is ranked fifth globally for years lived with disability. Yet hearing aid use is low among individuals with a hearing impairment. No studies have investigated a wide range of variables, this has limited intervention development.

The extent of major health consequences of COVID-19 is unclear, including risks of severe secondary infections. We conducted a matched cohort study based on 445,845 UK Biobank participants registered in England. Life-threatening secondary infections were defined as diagnoses of severesecondary infections with high mortality rates. The follow-up period was limited to 3 months after the initial CO VID-19 diagnosis.

SARS-CoV-2 is known to preferentially target older subjects and those with pre-existing conditions. Case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in all countries tested.

Most studies of severe/fatal COVID-19 risk have used routine/hospitalisation data without detailed pre-morbid characterisation. We investigated demographic, social (education, income, housing, employment), lifestyle (smoking, drinking, body mass index), biological (lipids, cystatin C, vitamin D), medical (comorbidities, medications) and environmental (air pollution) data from UK Biobank. Age, male sex and Black ethnicity, as well as comorbidity and oral steroid use at enrolment were associated with increased risk of death.

Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with increased susceptibility and severity for COVID-19. However, it is not clear whether these associations are genetically determined or not. We used a Phenome-Wide Association (PheWAS) approach to investigate the role of genetically determined CO VID-19 susceptibility on disease related outcomes.

Excessive alcohol intake is associated with 5.9% of global deaths. 7.6% of deaths can be attributed to alcohol intake. Previous studies identified a significant interaction between genotypes of the galanin (GAL) gene with anxiety and alcohol abuse in different male populations.

We conducted a phenome-wide analysis of loci with heterogeneous effects across African, Admixed-American, Central/South Asian, East Asian, European and Middle Eastern participants. We identified 82 independent genomic regions mapping variants showing genome-wide significant (GWS) associations.

We investigate polygenic risk score (PRS)-specific pleiotropy across 16 cancers in European ancestry individuals. Two pairs show bidirectional associations; the melanoma PRS is positively associated with oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer and vice versa.

Active living approaches seek to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time across different domains. There is little information on how movement behaviours in different domains relate to each other. We used compositional data analysis to explore associations between active commuting and patterns of movement behaviour during discretionary time.

Higher waist-to-hip ratio and BMI are independently positively associated with albuminuria. Adiposity-albuminuria associations appear strong among people with normal HbA1c, as well as people with pre-diabetes or diabetes.

People with 'CVD' or 'Type 2 diabetes + CVD' more likely to report simultaneous low physical activity, high TV viewing and poor sleep duration than those without disease. Non-diet behaviours were clustered, with people with CVD and Type 2 diabetes changing their diet in the past 5 years.

Genetic and hormonal factors have been suggested to influence human sexual orientation. Previous studied proposed brain differences related to sexual orientation and that these follow cross-sex shifted patterns. How genetic factors relate to brain structural variation remains largely unexplored.

Mapping gene-by-sex (GÃ—S) interactions remains a challenge likely because the magnitude of such an interaction is typically and exceedingly small. Traditional genome-wide association techniques may be underpowered to detect such events, due partly to the burden of multiple test correction. Here, we developed a local Bayesian regression (LBR) method to estimate sex-specific SNP marker effects.

Efforts to link variation in the human genome to phenotypes have progressed at a tremendous pace in recent decades. We discuss the natural next steps in data collection and methodology development. We focus on what can be gained by analyzing genotype and phenotype data from close relatives.

Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images has been successfully addressed with deep learning methods for a range of applications. However, this success is heavily dependent on the quality of the image that is being segmented. A commonly neglected point in the medical image analysis community is the vast amount of clinical images that have severe image artefacts.

 Classification of whole-brain functional connectivity MRI data with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has shown promise, but the complexity of these models impedes understanding which aspects of brain activity contribute to classification. We introduce a stochastic encoding method in an ensemble of CNNs to classify functional connectomes by sex.

Study used whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) images from UK Biobank (UKBB) and German National Cohort (GNC) MR imaging studies. Liver, spleen, left and right kidney, and pancreas were segmented manually on all 400 data sets, providing labeled ground truth data for training of deep learning models.

There is significant interest in the development and application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to neuroimaging data. Here, we compared the performance of three DNNs and a classical machine learning algorithm ( kernel regression) in predicting phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns.

Dementia has been associated with COVID-19 prevalence, but whether this reflects higher infection, older age of patients, or disease severity remains unclear. We investigated a cohort of 12,863 UK Biobank community-dwelling individuals > 65 years old.

Vitamin B6, B12, and folate have an effect on brain structure, especially among depressed people who follow a specific diet. Depression was more prevalent, and intake of vitamin B6 and B12 was lower among vegetarians, while non-vegetarians had a lower intake of folate. Vitamin B12 intake was positively associated with right pallidum.

Study used data on 251,125 individuals of white British ancestry from the UK Biobank. Found observational and genetic evidence for an association between depression and BMI. Carrying 10 additional BMI increasing alleles was associated with 0.24 standard deviation (SD) higher BMI among depressed individuals compared to 0.20 SD (95%CI 0.19-0.21) in controls.

Study employed data from 502,641 participants in the UK Biobank. Out of 58,833 participants with asthma and 13,462 with AD, the prevalence of DAS was 11.7% and 2.7%. DAS increased among participants with either asthma or AD, being highest within patients having both. Asthma and AD were associated with increased DAS during mid-adult years.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) can occur in patients who are ineligible for routine ultrasound screening. A simple AAA risk score was derived and compared with current guidelines used for ultrasound screening of AAA. Components of the risk score were age, weight, antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medication use, height and diastolic blood pressure.

UK Biobank study collected detailed dietary data using a web-based self-administered 24 h assessment tool, the Oxford WebQ. Top contributors to energy, saturated fat, and free sugars were broadly similar by sex and education category. Wine, beer, and fruit juices were the top beverage contributors to overall energy intake.

Oxford WebQ is a web-based 24-h dietary assessment method used in UK Biobank. The food composition table used to calculate nutrient intakes has been replaced with the UK Nutrient Databank. 35 new nutrients were incorporated in the updated version.

We scanned for deviations in chromosome X genotyping array intensity data in a population-based survey of 196,219 UK Biobank men. We detected 12 (0.006%) men with mosaic chromosome X gains &#8805; 2 Mb and found no evidence for mosaic X loss. This level of detection substantially lower than for autosomes or other sex chromosomes.

Mendelian randomization (MR) has developed into an established method for strengthening causal inference and estimating causal effects. However, genetic instruments remain controversial, as horizontal pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. We introduce MR using Gene-by-Environment interactions (MRGxE) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotsropic bias.

Heterogeneity in the phenotypic mean and variance across populations is often observed for complex traits. Here, we introduce a novel concept of genotype-by-population (G Ã— P) interaction where population is defined by the first and second ancestry principal components (PCs) We applied a reaction norm model fitting each of 70 complex traits with significant SNP-heritability.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic movement disorder that produces a variety of characteristic movement abnormalities. The ubiquity of wrist-worn accelerometry suggests a possible sensor modality for early detection of PD symptoms and subsequent tracking of PD symptom severity.

New method, Ward clustering, identifies Internal Node branch length outliers using Gene Scores. The objective of WINGS is to identify groups of phenotypes, or "clusters," sharing a core set of genes enriched for mutations in cases.

Hundreds of thousands of genetic variants have been reported to cause severe monogenic diseases. The probability that a variant carrier develops the disease (termed penetrance) is unknown for virtually all of them. The clinical utility of common polygenetic variation remains uncertain.

Previously generated genetic risk scores (GRSs) for type 1 diabetes (T1D) have not captured all known information at non-HLA loci or, particularly, at HLA risk loci. We aimed to more completely incorporate HLA alleles, their interactions, and recently discovered non- HLA locs into an improved T1D GRS. The improved GRS, the T1d GRS2, is highly useful for classifying adult incident diabetes type and improving newborn screening.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the eighth most common cancer in the UK. Over 12,000 new cases every year. The incidence of HNC is predicted to increase by 33% by 2035. Risk modelling produces personalised risk estimates for specific diseases.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) carries a poor prognosis, but earlier tumor detection would improve survival. We aimed to develop and externally validate a risk prediction model based on exposure to readily available risk factors to identify high-risk individuals. Candidate predictors were age, sex, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), education, cohabitation, physical exercise, and employment.

Risk prediction models for a range of heterogeneous CVDs, including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) The models incorporate various blood biomarkers and comorbidities to improve both individual and population stratification.

 multivariable risk prediction models have been developed to asses an individual's risk of developing specific cancers. Such models can be used in a variety of settings for prevention, screening, and guiding investigations and treatments.

Dietary interventions might have potential to protect against age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. There are associations between some nutrients, food groups, dietary patterns, and some domains of cognition. We observed associations between better general cognitive ability and higher intakes of fish, and unprocessed red meat; and moderate intakes of fibre, and milk.

A total of 416,588 participants (54% women) from the UK Biobank were included in the present study. High intake of red meat and processed meat was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. However, the consumption of fruits, vegetables, breakfast cereals, and dietary fiber was inversely associated with the risk.

UK Biobank recruited 77 004 men and women between 2006 and 2010. Dietary intake (Oxford WebQ) was used to calculate Recommended Food Score (RFS), Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) Higher RFS was also associated with lower risk of CVD mortality and MI.

Disinhibition is a prominent feature of multiple psychiatric disorders. It has been associated with poor long-term somatic outcomes. Modifiable lifestyle factors including diet and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may be associated with disinhibition. Their contributions have not previously been quantified among middle-aged/older adults.

UK Biobank is an open access prospective cohort of 500 000 men and women. Information on the frequency of consumption of main foods was collected at recruitment with a touchscreen questionnaire. The objectives of the present paper are to describe the repeatability of the touchscreen questionnaire in participants.

The 93-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) GPRS was associated with a higher BMI. The findings were broadly similar using WC as the outcome. These data suggest that the benefits of reducing the intake of fats may be more important in individuals with high genetic risk for obesity.

Study investigated 105,592 participants (47,308 men and 58,284 women) aged &#8805; 40 years. Dietary intake of total fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids was assessed at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 3.2 years, 832 men and 872 women developed disabling hearing impairment.

Few population-based studies of dietary habits have assessed depression and fluid intelligence. In total, 814 independent loci were utilized to calculate the individual polygenic risk score (PRS) for 143 dietary habit-related traits. For interaction analysis, we detected that OLFM1 interacted with champagne/white wine in depression, while  SYNPO2 interacted with coffee type in fluid Intelligence.

Low-carbohydrate diets are becoming increasingly popular, although their dietary quality outside of clinical studies is unknown. Both NCHO and LCHO groups consumed significantly more high-sugar, high-fat snacks.

Vegetarian diets are defined by the absence of meat and fish. Differences in the intake of other foods between meat-eaters and low or non-meat eaters are also important to document. We examined intakes of high-protein foods (meat, poultry, fish, legumes, nuts, vegetarian protein alternatives, dairy products, and eggs)

Dietary magnesium is integral to bone and muscle physiology. Relationship between magnesium and skeletal muscle and bone health has not been investigated concurrently to date. We analysed cross-sectional associations between dietary magnesium and muscle mass, grip strength, and bone density.

The fat type consumed is considered a risk factor for developing obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) This study aimed to investigate associations between dietary patterns with varying proportions of SFAs, MUFAs, or PUFAs and obesity, abdominal obesity, and self-reported T2D incidence. Two dietary patterns, DP1 and DP2, were identified.

Dietary intake and blood concentrations of vitamins E and C, lycopene, and carotenoids have been associated with a lower risk of incident (ischemic) stroke. Here, we investigated the associations between genetically influenced antioxidant levels in blood and ischemic stroke using Mendelian randomization. For absolute antioxidants levels, the odds ratios (ORs) ranged between 0.94 (95% CI, 0.85-1.05) for vitamin C. For metabolites, ORs ranged between 1.01 ( 95% CI,. 0.98-1,03) for retinol and 1.12 (95! CI,0.88- 1.42) for Vitamin E.

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a widely recognized neuroimaging technique to evaluate the microstructure of brain white matter. The objective of this study is to establish an improved automated DWI marker for estimating white matter integrity and investigating ageing related cognitive decline. The concept of Wasserstein distance was introduced to help establish a new measure: difference in distribution functions (DDF)

The identification of robust endotypes-disease subgroups of clinical relevance-is fundamental to stratified medicine. We hypothesized that HLA-C&#8727;06:02 status is the major genetic determinant of psoriasis. We compared demographic, environmental, and clinical variables of interest with those in people with a negative HLA.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rsfMRI) work has revealed changes in static connectivity related to age, sex, cognitive abilities and psychiatric symptoms. Little is known how these factors may alter the information flow. Dynamic graphical models (DGMs) can yield novel insight into directed functional connectivity.

The diversity in our genome is crucial to understanding the demographic history of worldwide populations. We have yet to know whether subtle genetic differences within a population can be disentangled. Here we apply dimensionality reduction methods to biobank-derived genomic data of a Japanese population.

Brain activity is a dynamic combination of the responses to sensory inputs and its own spontaneous processing. Such brain activity is continuously changing whether or not one is focusing on an externally imposed task. Previously, we have introduced an analysis method that allows us to model task or rest brain activity as a dynamic sequence of distinct brain networks.

We conducted genome-wide association analyses of asthma and body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) among 305,945 White British subjects recruited into the UK Biobank in 2006-2010. We identified a genome- wide-significant cross-phenotype association at rs705708 (asthma odds ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.07; P = 7.20 Ã— 10-9; and BMI &#946; = -0.065, 95â€™s confidence intervals: 0.087, 0.042) The association resides on 12q13.2.

Genes underneath signals from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for kidney function are promising targets for functional studies, but prioritizing variants and genes is challenging. By GWAS meta-analysis for creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the Chronic Kidney Disease Genetics Consortium and UK Biobank (n = 1,201,909), we expand the number of eGFRcrea loci.

Body composition (fat, skeletal muscle and bone mass) is an important determinant of overall health and risk of endocrine disorders such as type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. Although diet and physical activity are strongly implicated, body composition is also heritable. We conducted a discovery genome-wide association study on 31 phenotypes.

Study aims to discover new genetic loci associated with heart rate from Exome Chip meta-analyses. Heart rate measured from either elecrtrocardiograms or pulse recordings. Lead variants in four of the novel loci are non-synonymous variants in genes C10orf71, DALDR3, TESK2 and SEC31B.

24,130 patients diagnosed with depression were compared to 120,366 matched individuals without such a diagnosis. The median age at the time of the depression diagnosis was 62.0 years, and most of the patients were female (63.63%). 129 medical conditions were found to be significantly associated with a prior diagnosis of depression.

In midlife, transitions in social networks can relate to new leadership roles at work or becoming a caregiver for aging parents. Social behavior, personality predisposition, and demographic profile all have intimate links to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by low mood, psychomotor slowing and increased levels of the personality trait neuroticism. Factors also associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) It is possible that some cases of MDD may have a substantial genetic loading for SCZ. The presence of SCZ-like MDD subgroups would be indicated by an interaction between MDD status and polygenic risk ofSCZ on cognitive, personality and mood measures.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) results from somatic genomic alterations that drive clonal expansion of blood cells. Somatic gene mutations associated with hematologic malignancies have been associated with myeloid malignancy. mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) associated with lymphoidmalignancies. These genetic alterations can be readily detected in clinical sequencing panels and used with blood count parameters to identify individuals at high risk.

Vitamin D status varied among different ethnic groups and by season and geographical area within the UK. Male sex, abnormal body mass index, non-white ethnic backgrounds, smoking and being more socioeconomically deprived were associated with higher odds of vitamin D deficiency. Increasing age, taking vitamin D supplements and drinking alcohol was associated with lower odds of deficiency. These findings support the vitamin D supplementation recommendations of Public Health England.

Physical activity is a critical component of overall health and quality of life. There is a natural decline in physical activity associated with the aging process. Establishing normative trends of physical activity in aging populations is essential to developing public health guidelines.

 Eveningness is associated with a number of negative health outcomes and risk and prevalence for psychiatric disorder. Our understanding of the anatomical substrates of diurnal preference is limited. The current study used Voxel-Based Morphometry to compare grey matter volume in a large sample of healthy adults.

A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI associates with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We identified four variants in the gene ACVR1C which independently associated with reduced WHRadjBMI. Carriers of these variants exhibited reduced percent abdominal fat in DEXA imaging.

Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the bone marrow. Recurrent somatic mutations that lead to an expanded population of mutant blood cells is termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) We found CHIP to be associated with increased incident osteoporotic diagnoses and decreased bone mineral density.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune condition in which inflammation plays a central role that also affects the white matter. We used statistical genetics techniques to assess whether having genetically elevated white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume was associated with increased MS risk. Whole genome analysis did not reveal any overlap of risk between the traits.

GPRS-obesity was associated with BMI (&#946;:0.54 kg.m-2 per standard deviation (SD) increase in GPRS, [95% CI: 0.53; 0.56]; P = 2.1 Ã— 10-241) among inactive individuals. There was a significant interaction between GPRs-ob obesity and objectively measured PA. No significant interactions were found for commuting mode (car, public transport, active commuters) The adiposity benefits of high PA and low sedentary behaviour may be particularly important in individuals with high genetic risk for obesity.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heritable and highly debilitating condition. It is commonly associated with subcortical volumetric abnormalities, the most replicated of these being reduced hippocampal volume. In this study, we provide some evidence that hippocampusal volume and MDD may share genetic architecture in a subgroup of individuals.

Physical activity (PA) has beneficial effects on many alcohol related outcomes. Data suggest PA may offset the association between alcohol consumption and mortality. Study examined the joint associations of PA and alcohol on all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality.

We analysed the UK Biobank Cohort study linked to Hospital Episode Statistics. Surgery patients were matched with controls who did not have bariatric surgery. Annual and cumulative hospital costs were assessed for the surgery and control groups. Compared with controls, surgical patients had significantly higher inpatient expenditures.

In men, height was positively associated with incidence risk of all-cause cancer and at five sites. In women, it was associated with breast, melanoma, lymphatic, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and all- Cause cancer. The strength of the association did not differ by IGF-1 concentration.

TV viewing is associated with an increase in body mass index (BMI) as well as overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. UK Biobank recruited across 35 centres in the UK between 2006 and 2010. Each additional hour of television viewing per day was associated with a 0.54 increase in BMI.

The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising, and relatively little is known about modifiable risk factors for the condition. Observational studies have suggested a link between adiposity and thyroid cancer, but these are subject to confounding and reverse causality. Here, we used data from the UK Biobank to investigate whether adiposity causes benign nodular thyroid disease and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Pregnancy history was reported by women participating in UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 at age 40-69 years. Cardiac structure and function were assessed by magnetic resonance (CMR) steady-state free precession imaging at 1.5 Tesla. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurements were taken for both common carotid arteries using a CardioHealth Station. No significant differences were evident in women who reported pregnancy loss compared to other groups.

The study employed data from the UK Biobank participants: 495,327 in cross-sectional (2006-2010) and 16,875 in longitudinal (2014-2016) analyses. Musculoskeletal pain was diagnosed by the participants' reports of back, knee, hip, or neck/shoulder pain.

Fitness was estimated using a submaximal cycle ergometer test. All results were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary factors, body composition, and morbidity at baseline. High level of fitness was associated with a greater incidence of atrial fibrillation and prostate cancer.

Every one mmol/mol increase in genetically proxied HbA1c was associated with an 11% higher CHD risk (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05, 1.18) There was no evidence favouring a non-linear relationship over a linear one. In individuals without diabetes mellitus, lowering average blood glucose levels may reduceCHD risk in a dose-dependent way.

The otherwise common HLA haplotype DR15-DQ6 is rare, and highly protective. Adult-onset type 1 diabetes is now known to represent more overall cases than childhood onset. We assessed the proportion of type 1. diabetes cases presenting through the first 50 years of life with DR15. DQ6 compared with population controls.

Over 500,000 participants were recruited to the UK Biobank cohort. Alcohol consumption was self-reported as pints beer/cider, glasses champagne/white wine, glasses of red wine, and measures of spirits per week. All-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular events, and cancer were studied.

 Pharmacogenetics studies how genetic variation leads to variability in drug response. Guidelines for selecting the right drug and right dose for patients based on their genetics are clinically effective, but are widely unused. Without measurements of genotype, physicians and patients may adjust dosage in a manner that reflects the underlying genetics.

UK Biobank is an international health resource enabling research into the genetic and lifestyle determinants of common diseases of middle and older age. Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System is a centralized microbiology database covering English clinical diagnostics laboratories.

Study looked at 334,507 white British participants from the UK Biobank cohort. Found that 1 additional year of education was significantly related to higher total amount of alcohol intake. Causal relations with total amount and frequency of alcohol drinking were more evident among women.

Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy worldwide. Physical activity and a healthy diet contribute to energy balance. We suggest that individual differences in energy balance can be explained by genetic polymorphisms involved in mitochondria.

Between 2006 and 2010, 357,419 participants with genetic and complete dietary data from the UK Biobank were enrolled and prospectively followed up to 2017. The genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated on the basis of 424 variants associated with T2D risk.

Study aimed to estimate the causal effect of education on refractive error using regression discontinuity analysis. The analysis sample comprised 21,548 UK Biobank participants born in a nine-year interval centered on September 1957. In OLS analysis, the ROSLA 1972 reform was associated with a -0.29 D.

Lead is pervasive, although lead exposure has fallen in response to public health efforts. Lead is positively associated with cardiovascular disease and hypertension. We used separate-sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments.

Obesity may prevent people from being in paid work through poor health or through social discrimination. We studied genetic variants robustly associated with body mass index (BMI) to investigate its causal effects on employment. Socioeconomic indicators also investigated were hours worked, household income, educational attainment and Townsend deprivation index.

Mendelian randomization analyses were performed to infer phenome-wide effects of free testosterone on 461 outcomes in 161,268 males from the UK Biobank study. Lifelong increased free testosterone had beneficial effects on increased bone mineral density, and decreased body fat. It had adverse effects on decreased HDL, and increased risks of prostate cancer, androgenic alopecia, spinal stenosis, and hypertension.

Thyroid hormone is essential for optimal human neurodevelopment and may modify the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) The brain structures involved are unknown and it is unclear if the adult brain is also susceptible to changes in thyroid status.

 Randomized trials of salt restriction have consistently demonstrated that decreasing salt consumption lowers blood pressure.

We examined the within-person variability in spot urinary sodium excretion and its impact on associations with systolic blood pressure and risk of incident cardiovascular disease.

Existing statistical methods become rate limiting for large biobank-scale sequencing studies with correlated samples. We propose efficient Mixed-model Association tests for GEne-Environment interactions. The computational complexity is dramatically reduced in a whole genome GEI analysis.

There is an increasing need for conducting genetic genealogical searches efficiently. Computationally, this task amounts to identifying shared DNA segments between a query individual and a very large panel containing millions of haplotypes. The existing algorithm (Durbin's Algorithm 5) can only identify set-maximal matches.

In genome-wide association studies, ordinal categorical phenotypes are widely used to measure human behaviors, satisfaction, and preferences. We propose an efficient mixed model association test, proportional odds logistic mixed model (POLMM) POLMM is computationally efficient to analyze large datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples.

Polygenic risk scores are emerging as a potentially powerful tool to predict future phenotypes of target individuals. 5,000 individuals with first-degree relatives of target Individuals can achieve a prediction accuracy similar to that of around 220,000 unrelated individuals.

Principal component analysis (PCA) of genetic data is routinely used to infer ancestry and control for population structure in various genetic analyses. However, conducting PCA analyses can be complicated and has several potential pitfalls. These pitfalls include capturing linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure instead of population structure, and projected PCs that suffer from shrinkage bias.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting both children and adults. We report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 69,189 cases and 702,199 controls. We find 88 asthma risk variants at 56 loci, 19 previously unreported.

Hormone concentrations were measured in serum collected in 2006-2010, and in a repeat subsample (N ~ 5000) in 2012-13. Incident cancers were identified through data linkage. Cancer risk was positively associated with testosterone in post-menopausal women.

BRCA1/2 mutation carriers had a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for EC. Highest risk observed for the rare subgroups of serous-like and p53-abnormal EC in BRCa1 mutation carriers.

Data were obtained from 398 628 UK Biobank prospective cohort study participants (40-69 years) recruited between 2006 and 2010. Hazard ratios between 24-hour sodium excretion were estimated from spot urinary sodium concentrations across incident CVD and its components. In restricted cubic splines analyses, there was little evidence for an association. An inverse association was observed with heart failure, but that was no longer apparent.

Genomic structural equation modelling (SEM) outperforms the other methods in accurately estimating conditional genetic effects and their standard errors. We apply Genomic SEM to fertility data in the UK Biobank and partition the genetic effect into female and male fertility and a sibling specific effect. We identify a novel locus for fertility and genetic correlations between fertility and educational attainment.

Parental genetic effects may be defined as the influence of parental genotypes on offspring phenotypes over and above that which results from the transmission of genes from parents to their children. Given the relative paucity of large-scale family-based cohorts around the world, it is difficult to demonstrate parental genetic effects on human traits, particularly at individual loci. In this manuscript, we illustrate how parental. genetic effects can be estimated at individual Loci in principle using large.-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data.

The effective sample size (ESS) is a metric used to summarize in a single term the amount of correlation in a sample. It is of particular interest when predicting the statistical power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on linear mixed models. We introduce an analytical form of the ESS for mixed-model GWAS of quantitative traits.

Study assesses evidence of causality for various CVDs in a 2-sample Mendelian randomization framework. Estimates potential reduction in the prevalence of these diseases attributable to long-term population shifts in systolic blood pressure (SBP)

Non-additive genetic variance for complex traits is traditionally estimated from data on relatives. It is notoriously difficult to estimate without bias in non-laboratory species, including humans. Here, we jointly estimate the proportion of variance explained by additive (h SNP  2 ) and dominance (&#948; SNP 2 ) genetic variance in a single analysis model. We first show by simulations that our model leads to unbiased estimates.

Gene-&#949; is a new approach for identifying statistical associations between sets of variants and quantitative traits. We reformulate the genome-wide SNP-level null hypothesis to identify spurious small-to-intermediate SNP effects and classify them as non-causal. We identify enriched genes in biologically relevant pathways.

 differences in the content and distribution of body fat and ectopic lipids may be responsible for ethnic variations in metabolic disease susceptibility. The aim of this study was to examine the ethnic distribution ofBody fat in two separate UK-based populations.

People from South Asian and black minority ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown whether deprivation mediates this excess ethnic risk. The excess risk could be substantially reduced with population level policies targeting material deprivation.

Serum urate is associated with BMD and may be a protective factor. However, the exact association and mechanism are still unclear. We performed a genome-wide gene-environmental interaction study to explore the interaction effects between gene and urate on BMD.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic risk variants for cancers. We constructed a site-specific polygenic risk score (PRS) for each of these nine cancers using their GWAS-identified risk variants. Using PRS, 63.0% of the participants could be classified as having an over twofold elevated risk for at least one cancer.

It has been hypothesised that nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCL/P) and cancer may share aetiological risk factors. Several genes (e.g., CDH1, AXIN2) have been implicated in the aetiologies of both phenotypes. Using a primary sample of 5,048 OC/OPC cases and 5,450 controls of European ancestry and a replication sample of 750 cases and 336,319 controls from UK Biobank we estimate genetic overlap.

The polygenic risk score (PRS) of sex hormone traits was calculated from individual-level genotype data of the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank cohort. We observed positive association between SHBG and the frequency of alcohol consumption in middle-aged males and females. In addition, estradiol was positively associated with alcohol consumption (b = 0.0128, p = 1.96 Ã— 10-8) in middle aged males. Finally, Tenascin R (TNR) (rs34633780) interacting with total testosterone for fluid intelligence was identified.

The course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe in patients. One possibility is that genetic variation is partly responsible for the highly variable response. We evaluated how well a genetic risk score based on chromosomal-scale length variation and machine learning classification algorithms could predict severity of response.

A small number of circulating proteins have been reported to be associated with breast cancer risk. Herein, we attempted to identify novel protein biomarkers for breast cancer via the integration of genomics and proteomics data. In the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), with 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European descendants, we evaluated the associations of the genetically predicted concentrations of >1,400 circulating proteins.

The predictive utility of polygenic scores is increasing, and many polygenic scoring methods are available, but it is unclear which method performs best. Eight polygenic score methods were tested: p-value thresholding and clumping (pT+clump), SBLUP, lassosum, LDpred1, LDPred2, PRScs, DBSLMM and SBayesR.

Study included 409   692 adults of European ancestry. 2 were associated with T1DM and 3 with T2DM, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, and population structure. Common host genetic effects may play a role in the molecular mechanism linking TB and diabetes.

High milk intake has been associated with cardio-metabolic risk. We conducted a Mendelian Randomization (MR) study to obtain evidence for the causal relationship. We used the lactase persistence (LCT-13910 C > T, rs4988235) variant as an instrumental variable.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) results from pathogenic variants in ferrochelatase (FECH) EPP results from coinheriting a rare pathogenic variant in trans of a common hypomorphic variant c.315-48T>C (minor allele frequency 0.05). The estimated prevalence of EPP derived from the number of diagnosed individuals in Europe is 0.00092%, but this may be conservative due to underdiagnosis.

Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. We aimed to identify novel biochemical factors for prostate cancer incidence and mortality in UK Biobank. Prostate cancer incidence was positively associated with circulating vitamin D, urea and phosphate concentrations and inversely associated with glucose, total protein and aspartate aminotransferase.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common type of liver cancer. Studies in women and men have reported higher circulating oestradiol is associated with increased ICC risk. No observational studies have examined the associations between exogenous hormone use and reproductive factors.

Exome sequencing explored protein-altering variants and their consequences in 454,787 participants in the UK Biobank study. We identified 12 million coding variants, including 1 million loss-of-function and around 1.8 million deleterious missense variants. When these were tested for association with 3,994 health-related traits, we found 564 genes with trait associations at P &#8804; 2.18 Ã— 10-11.

The UK Biobank is a prospective study of 502,543 individuals. The data include 198,269 autosomal predicted loss-of-function (LOF) variants. Nearly all genes (more than 97%) had at least one carrier with a LOF variant.

Integration of DNA sequencing data with electronic health records (EHRs) could enhance our understanding of the contribution of rare genetic variation to human disease. The clinical impact of rare loss-of-function variants has yet to be determined for most genes.

It is estimated that up to 10% of cancer incidents are attributed to inherited genetic alterations. It was theorized that ultra-rare variants partially account for the missing heritable component.

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Genetic variation contributes to initiation, regular smoking, nicotine dependence, and cessation. We present a Fagerstr&#246;m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)-based genome-wide association study in 58,000 smokers.

Ethnic inequalities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations and mortality have been widely reported, but there is scant understanding of how they are embodied. The UK Biobank prospective cohort study comprises approximately half a million people who were aged 40-69 years at study induction.

 Mechanisms underlying adiposity-colorectal cancer (CRC) association are incompletely understood. Using UK Biobank data, we investigated the role of C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin-A1c (Hb a1c) and (jointly) sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone, in explaining this association.

Method for performing Mendelian randomization studies using only summary statistics. We apply the approach to the UK Biobank cohort to investigate the causal role of sleep disturbance on HbA1c.

Family history contains information on disease status of relatives, adding valuable information about the probands' health problems and risk of diseases. Incorporating data from FH is a cost-effective way to improve statistical evidence in genetic studies. The development of sequencing technology calls for new powerful methods to detect disease associations.

Short and long sleep durations have adverse effects on physical and mental health. Most studies are based on self-reported sleep duration and health status. This longitudinal study aims to investigate objectively measured sleep duration.

Weighted burden analysis can incorporate variants with different frequencies and annotations into a combined test for association between a gene and a phenotype. There are marked differences in optimal weighting schemes between genes, both with respect to allele frequency and to annotation. It seems helpful to weight rare variants more highly than common ones and to give loss of function variants higher weights.

We leveraged a large prospective cohort, the UK-Biobank (UKBB,  N  ~ 397,000), and studied associations of prior use of all level-4 ATC drug categories with COVID-19 diagnosis and severity. We observed strong and highly consistent protective associations with statins. We also observed protective associations by influenza, pneumococcal, and several other vaccines.

There is a well-established relationship between cannabis use and psychosis, although the exact nature of this relationship is not fully understood. Recent studies have observed significant genetic overlap between a diagnosis of schizophrenia and lifetime cannabis use. This study aimed to examine whether genetic overlap also occurs for subclinical psychosis (schizotypy) and cannabis use, as well as examining the phenotypic association.

Study looked at all UK Biobank participants who underwent imaging up to December 2015. Brain, cardiac and body magnetic resonance, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry images from the first 1000 participants were reviewed systematically by radiologists for PSIFs. Thereafter, radiographers flagged concerning images for radiologists' review.

Women, people aged over 65 years, underweight people and those with rheumatoid arthritis were most likely to have sarcopenia. Overweight, obesity, as well as a self-reported higher intake of energy, protein, vitamins (B12 and B9) and minerals (potassium, calcium and magnesium) were associated with lower odds.

We present a comprehensive statistical framework to analyze data from genome-wide association studies of polygenic traits. In contrast with standard approaches, our method can leverage sophisticated multivariate algorithms but makes no parametric assumptions about the unknown relation between genotypes and phenotype.

Diet and familial factors have a major role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) It remains unclear whether familial predisposition to CVD modifies the association between dietary factors and CVD. In this prospective cohort of the UK Biobank, 462,155 CVD-free participants were included in 2006-2010 and followed for CVD incidence until 2020.

Genome-wide studies often exclude family members, even though they are a valuable source of information. We identified parent-offspring pairs, siblings and couples in the UK Biobank and implemented a family-based DNA-derived heritability method. Compared to estimates from unrelated individuals, total heritability increased from 10 to 27%.

UK Biobank, an observational cohort recruited between 2006 and 2010. Of 401,268 participants in total, 13,331 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 2282 had severe infection by end of January 2021. In unadjusted models, participants with &#8805;2 family members with diabetes were more likely to be tested positive. The excess risk for severe infection was no longer significant after adjusting for demographics.

Population stratification (PS) is a major confounder in genome-wide association studies. To adjust for PS, principal component analysis (PCA)-based ancestry prediction has been widely used. We propose two alternative approaches: bias-adjusted projection (AP) and online ADP (OADP)

Haplotype phasing is the estimation of haplotypes from genotype data. We present a fast, accurate, and memory-efficient method that scales to large-scale SNP array and sequence data. The method uses marker windowing and composite reference haplotypes to reduce memory usage and computation time.

We observe significant genetic correlation of birth location with a range of lifestyle-related traits, even after adjustment for population structure.

Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated as watts per kilogram from a submaximal bicycle test in 77 169 men and women from the UK Biobank cohort. Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 1731 participants died. Mortality risk was 1.78 times higher in unfit-obese men but not higher in obese-fit men (0.94 [95% CI, 0.60-1.48]). In contrast, there was no increased risk in obesity-unfit women (1.09 [95%) as compared with the reference.

Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common autoimmune disease and is highly heritable. A low-frequency (1.36%) intronic variant in FLT3 (rs76428106-C) has the largest effect on risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. It is also associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 1.90, P = 6.46 Ã— 10-4), rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP-positive rheumatic arthritis and coeliac disease.

Both fat mass and lean mass are under strong genetic determinants and are correlated. We identified four loci that were significant at the genome-wide significance (GWS, &#945; = 5.0 Ã— 10-8) level at the discovery meta-analysis. The above four pleiotropic loci may play a pleiotropeic role for fat mass development.

Frailty has been linked to increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, but evidence is mainly limited to hospitalized older individuals. This study aimed to assess and compare predictive abilities of different frailty and comorbidity measures for COVID.19 mortality in a community sample and inpatients.

We identified associations for variants in GCK, HNF1A and PDX1, which are known to be involved in Mendelian forms of diabetes. We uncovered novel associations for GIGYF1, a gene not previously implicated by human genetics in diabetes.

The genetic aetiology of broad sense (non-suicidal and suicidal) self-harm has not been characterised on the molecular level. In the present study, we conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using data from the UK Biobank. We also perform genome wide gene-based tests and characterize the SNP heritability and genetic correlations between these traits.

Genome-wide association study of sex in 3.3 million males and females identified 158 autosomal loci spuriously associated with sex. Sex exhibits artifactual autosomal heritability in the presence of sex-differential participation bias. Findings highlight a new challenge that genetic studies may face as sample sizes continue to grow.

The burden of infections on an individual and public health is profound. Many observational studies have shown a link between infections and the pathogenesis of disease. A greater understanding of the role of host genetics is essential. Children from the longitudinal birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children had 14 antibodies measured in plasma at age 7.

Serum concentration of hepatic enzymes are linked to liver dysfunction, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. We perform genetic analysis on serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) using data on 437,438 UK Biobank participants.

We identified 16 significant loci that contain genes associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and regulation of cytoskeletal arborization.

Males have a higher prevalence of asthma in childhood than females. The 'adolescent switch' observed between sexes during puberty has been hypothesised to be due to fluctuating sex hormones. Robust evidence of the involvement of sex hormones in asthma could lead to development of therapeutic interventions.

Using over 38,000 abdominal MRI scans in the UK Biobank, we used deep learning to quantify volume, fat, and iron in seven organs and tissues. We show that these traits have a substantial heritable component (8-44%) and identify 93 independent genome-wide significant associations.

We additionally identified 27 unique genetic loci that contributed to one or more S BM networks.

Higher scores on the personality trait of neuroticism are associated with worse mental and physical health. This study found that, although individuals who were higher on general neuroticism lived shorter lives, individuals whose neuroticism was characterized by worry and vulnerability lived longer lives.

Human DNA polymorphisms vary across geographic regions. Most commonly observed variation reflects distant ancestry differences. Of 33 traits analysed, 21 showed significant geographic clustering at the genetic level. Alleles associated with educational attainment showed the most clustering.

We found associations between type 2 diabetes (T2D) instruments and forced vital capacity (FVC) as well as FEV1/FVC. Body mass index (BMI) instruments were associated to all lung function traits and C-reactive protein (CRP) instruments to FVC. These genetic associations provide evidence for a causal effect of cardio-metabolic traits on lung function.

Cortical thickness, surface area and volumes vary with age and cognitive function, and in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here we report heritability, genetic correlations and genome-wide associations of these cortical measures across the whole cortex.

Pain, neuroticism and depression share partially overlapping genetic risk factors. All pain phenotypes, except hip pain and knee pain, had significant and positive genetic correlations with depressive symptoms, major depressive disorders and neuroticism.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Despite overlap between genetic risk loci for ALL and hematologic traits, the etiological relevance of dysregulated blood-cell homeostasis remains unclear. Study shows that a genetically induced shift toward higher lymphocyte counts, overall and in relation to monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets, confers an increased susceptibility to ALL.

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a description of a clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors in the same individual. This study searched for genetic loci associated with all five prespecified components of MetS to find a common pathophysiological link for this risk factor clustering.

Adiposity and ectopic fat play a role in type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases. We aimed to identify two clusters of adiposity genetic variants: one with "adverse" metabolic effects (UFA) and the other with, paradoxically, "favorable" metabolic effect (FA) UFA was associated with an adverse metabolic profile, higher risk of disease, higher CRP, and higher fat in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas for UFA and a favorable metabolic profile for FA.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is associated with multiple risk factors but determining causality is difficult. We used a genetic approach [Mendelian randomization (MR)] to identify potential causal modifiable risk factors for GORD. We tested associations between GORD and four adiposity measures.

A favorable lifestyle was associated with 22% and 31% reductions in invasive breast cancer risk, respectively. For premenopausal women, the greatest risk reduction in association with the HLI was seen among those with a high PRS. There was an additive but not multiplicative interaction between HLI score and PRS for postmenopausal and, to a lesser extent, pre menopausal women.

Depression is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. Previous large-scale genetic studies of depression have explored genetic risk factors of depression case-control status or aggregated sums of depressive symptoms.

The majority of those who experience clinical anxiety and/or depressive symptoms in the population do not receive treatment. If genes influence who seeks and receives treatment, selection bias will confound genomic studies of treatment response.

We sought to perform a genomic evaluation of the risk of incident cancer in statin users, free of cancer at study entry. Patients who previously participated in two phase IV trials (TNT and IDEAL) with genetic data were used (npooled = 11,196). A GWAS meta-analysis using Cox modeling was conducted in the pooled cohort and sex-stratified.

Birth weight (BW) is an important predictor of newborn survival and health. Twins have a lower BW than singletons as a result of a different pattern of fetal growth and shorter gestational duration. We found a positive correlation of beta values with 150 previously reported genome-wide significant variants for singleton BW.

Biobanks with exomes linked to electronic health records (EHRs) enable the study of genetic pleiotropy between rare variants and seemingly disparate diseases. We analyzed 213,084 exomes, along with a targeted set of retinal, cardiac, and immune phenotypes from two large-scale EHR-linked biobanks. A burden of deleterious variants in ERCC6 was strongly associated with (1) retinal disorders; (2) cardiac and electrocardiogram perturbations; and (3) immunodeficiency.

Large studies such as UK Biobank are increasingly used for GWAS and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. However, selection into and dropout from studies may bias genetic and phenotypic associations. We examine genetic factors affecting participation in four optional components in up to 451,306 participants.

Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in circulating white blood cells is the most common form of clonal mosaicism1-5. We estimate that 20% of the male population represented in the UK Biobank study (n = 205,011) has detectable LOY. We identify 156 autosomal genetic determinants of LOY, which we replicate in 757,114 men of European and Japanese ancestry.

The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine the causality of the association between smoking and 14 different cardiovascular diseases. The primary genetic instrument comprised 361 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with smoking initiation. Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation was most strongly and consistently associated with higher odds of coronary artery disease, heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, ischaemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and arterial hypertension.

Growing evidence has suggested an association between sleep duration and Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear if sleep duration is a manifestation of the AD disease process. We studied whether genetic liability for AD predicts sleep duration using a genetic risk score.

Depression is a common and clinically heterogeneous mental health disorder. Stratification of depression may align sub-diagnoses more closely with their underling aetiology and provide more tractable targets for research and effective treatment.

Sociability is a trait that is continuously distributed in the general population. decreased sociability represents an early manifestation of several brain disorders. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a sociability score based on four social functioning-related self-report questions from 342,461 adults in the UK Biobank. The score was significantly heritable (SNP h2 of 6%).

 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables non-invasive imaging of the retina. We identify 46 loci associated with thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer or ganglion cell inner plexiform layer. Only one of these loci has been associated with glaucoma. Mendelian randomisation does not support inner retinal thickness being on the same genetic causal pathway as glau coma.

Atezolizumab-induced thyroid dysfunction is associated with longer survival. Genetic variation associated with thyroid autoimmunity interacts with biological pathways driving the systemic immune response to PD-1 blockade.

Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) represents an emerging pharmaceutical approach for the treatment of heart failure. The mechanisms by which SGLT 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of heart Failure are not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC5A2 gene, encoding S GLT2, and heart failure, and to assess potential mediators of this association.

Most of the genetic basis of chronic liver disease remains undiscovered. We identified a genetic locus in mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAM) associated with increased levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin. This common genetic variant was also associated with an allele dose-dependent risk of alcohol-associated liver disease.

The number of gluten-free diet followers without celiac disease (CD) is increasing. Little is known about the characteristics of these individuals. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of following a gluten- free diet was performed.

We used germline genetic variants for nevus count to test whether this phenotypic trait is a risk-marker for cancer. We calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) using individual-level data in the UK Biobank and QSkin cohort. In both cohorts, those in the highest nevUS PRS quartile had higher risks of melanoma. We found no consistent evidence that nevu count PRS were associated with risks of developing internal cancers.

Genetic components of intelligence affect measured intelligence and educational attainment. These factors affect the prevalence of CAD via a series of unfavorable risk factor profiles. We found significant inverse correlations between gIQ and risk factors of CAD including smoking, BMI, T2D, hypertension, and a positive correlation with HDL cholesterol.

Lower levels of physical activity (PA) have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

We identify 339 distinct disease association profiles and use multiple approaches to link clusters to the underlying biological pathways.

Phenotype Latent variable Extraction of disease misdiagnosis (PheLEx) is a GWAS analysis framework that learns and corrects misclassified phenotypes using structured genotype associations within a dataset. We demonstrate the potential of PheLEX for extracting new potential loci from existing GWAS data by analyzing bipolar disorder and epilepsy phenotypes available from UK Biobank.

Mendelian randomization phenome-wide association study (MR-pheWAS) of age at menarche with 17,893 health-related traits in UK Biobank (n = 181,318) using PHESANT. After exclusion of variants associated with BMI, the genetic risk score for age atMenarche was related to 37 traits. Follow-up analyses indicated imprecise evidence of an effect of younger age at Menarche on greater bone-mineral density, lower lung function, and higher neuroticism score.

We aimed to identify brain regions of the highest vulnerability to AD using a data-driven search in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. Whole-genome analysis revealed a common variant in SHARPIN that was associated with this imaging feature.

Lung cancer is genetically correlated with reduced forced expiratory volume in one second. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate that reduced FEV1 increases squamous cell carcinoma risk. Findings support a causal role of pulmonary impairment in lung cancer etiology.

Odds of persisting amblyopia were 5.91 (5.24-6.66) and 2.49 (2.21-2.81) times greater in cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively, than cohort 3. The odds were also higher for more socioeconomically deprived groups and for white ethnicity. Reduced participation in sport, adverse general and mental health, and well-being were all independently associated with persisting Amblyopia. The observed adverse outcomes were largely those not directly mediated by vision.

Analyzing the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) sequence data in 10,338 individuals from five studies and four ancestries. The most associated G6PD variant (rs1050828-T, p.Val98Met, MAF = 12% in African-Americans, 2% in Hispanics) lowered HbA1c (-0.88% in hemizygous males, -0.34% in heterozygous females)

We conducted a prospective cohort study in 60,235 UK Biobank participants (mean age: 56; 56% female) Exposure was baseline daily movement behaviours and self-reported total sleep. Outcomes were depression and anxiety symptoms at follow-up. Replacing 60 min of sedentary behaviour with light activity, moderate-to-vigorous activity, and sleep was associated with lower depression symptom scores.

Of 502,543 participants, 3849 (1.4%) of women and 1643 (0.7%) of men had a diagnosis of RA. Corticosteroid and DMARD therapy, but not biologic therapy, were associated with a lower eBMD with RA.

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a circulating glycoprotein and a regulator of sex hormone levels. The molecular nature of SHBG makes it a feasible target for preventative or therapeutic interventions. A systematic study of its effects across the human phenome may uncover novel associations.

Exposure to different workplace hazards were analyzed among 119,413 participants from the UK Biobank cohort. Shift workers had a higher prevalence ratio (PR) than other workers of being exposed to almost all identified hazards both before or after 1980.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation methods provide an efficient and automated way for clinicians to assess the structure and function of the heart in cardiac MR images. While CNNs can generally perform the segmentation tasks with high accuracy when training and test images come from the same domain, their performance often degrades dramatically on images from different scanners or clinical sites. We propose a simple yet effective way for improving the network generalization ability by carefully designing data normalization and augmentation strategies.

Study explores the predictive utility of gene expression risk scores (GeRS) calculated using imputed gene expression and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) results. GeRS significantly predicted a range of outcomes, with elastic net models combining GeRS across SNP-weight sets improving prediction. The proportion of SNP-based heritability attributable to cis-regulated expression was modest for most outcomes.

Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) are large chromosomal gains, losses and copy-neutral losses of heterozygosity in peripheral leukocytes. Many individuals with detectable mCAs have no notable adverse outcomes. MCA-associated gene dosage alterations as well as clonal expansion of mutated leukocyte clones could increase susceptibility to disease.

The majority of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been developed and optimized in individuals of European ancestry. We find that including into the PRS variants discovered in African ancestry individuals has the potential to achieve unbiased estimates of genetic risk across global populations and admixed individuals.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently proposed to widen the current lung cancer screening guideline to include less-heavy smokers. We constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) using lung cancer risk variants. During a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 1449 incident cases of lung cancer were identified.

Polygenic risk prediction is a widely investigated topic because of its promising clinical applications. Genetic variants in functional regions of the genome are enriched for complex trait heritability. We introduce a method for polygenic prediction, LDpred-funct, that leverages trait-specific functional priors to increase prediction accuracy.

Extreme presentations of common disease in children are often presumed to be of Mendelian etiology, but their polygenic basis has not been fully explored.

Brain age is a widely used index for quantifying individuals' brain health. Higher-than-expected brain age is thought partially to reflect above-average rate of brain aging. We tested this assumption by assessing the relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of  brain age.

We identified patients with one of five common complex diseases among 44,550 individuals who underwent exome sequencing in the UK Biobank. We derived PRS for these five diseases, and identified pathogenic rare variant heterozygotes. Rare pathogenic variants were more prevalent among affected patients with a low PRS.

Identifying disease subtypes and corresponding biomarkers can substantially improve clinical diagnosis and treatment selection. Discovering these subtypes in noisy, high dimensional biomedical data is often impossible for humans and challenging for machines. Instead of analyzing the original data, we train a diagnostic classifier and extract instance-wise explanations for the classifier's decisions.

The contribution of gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions for many human traits and diseases is poorly characterized. We propose a Bayesian whole-genome regression model for joint modeling of main genetic effects and GxE interactions. The method is called LEMMA (Linear Environment Mixed Model Analysis)

Modeling how individuals evolve over time is a fundamental problem in the natural and social sciences. Existing datasets are often cross-sectional with each individual observed only once. Motivated by the study of human aging, we present an interpretable latent-variable model.

Retinal detachment (RD) is a serious and common condition, but genetic studies to date have been hampered by the small size of the assembled cohorts. In the UK Biobank data set, where RD was ascertained by self-report or hospital records, genetic correlations between RD and high myopia or cataract operation were 0.46 and 0.44. Replication in the 23andMe data set firmly establishes six RD risk loci.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is involved in several processes relevant to carcinogenesis. We used 416 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with serum IGF-1 levels to assess the potential causal associations between this hormone and site-specific cancers through Mendelian randomization. The odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation increase of IGF- 1 levels was 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.22; P = .03) in UK Biobank.

Here we explore the harmonisation of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measures across two major studies of healthy elderly populations.

Integration of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies is needed to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying GWAS hits. Gene-level association methods such as PrediXcan can prioritize candidate targets. However, limited eQTL sample sizes and absence of relevant developmental and disease context restrict our ability to detect associations.

We evaluated whether the association between cigarette smoking and dementia risk is modified by genetic predisposition including apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and polygenic risk. We included 193,198 UK Biobank participants aged 60-73 years without dementia at baseline. Of non-APOE-&#949;4 carriers, 0.89% (95% CI 0.73-1.08%) current smokers developed dementia compared with 0.49% of never smokers.

Alcohol consumption and genetic risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) are among many factors known to be associated with brain structure in cognitively healthy adults. We hypothesized that there is an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and a 33-SNP AD polygenic risk score (PRS) on the cortical thickness of brain regions. We found a significant, positive association with AD Cortical Thickness Signature among high-risk subjects.

Both lifestyle and genetic factors confer risk for cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The interactions between these 2 groups of risk factors were not comprehensively understood due to previous poor estimation of genetic risk. We developed enhanced polygenic risk scores (PRS) and systematically investigated multiplicative and additive interactions between PRS and lifestyle.

Mendelian randomization has been previously used to estimate the effects of binary and ordinal categorical exposures-e.g. Type 2 diabetes or educational attainment defined by qualification-on outcomes. We show that a higher educational-attainment PGS is strongly associated with lower smoking initiation and higher odds of glasses use at age 15&#x2009;years. These associations were replicated in sibling models.

Genetically predicted fasting insulin levels were positively associated with cancers of the uterus, kidney, pancreas, and lung. There was limited evidence supporting causal associations between fasting glucose and cancer.

Most existing analysis methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) perform only univariate regression. We extend and efficiently implement iterative hard thresholding (IHT) for multiple regression, treating all SNPs simultaneously. In our simulations, IHT recovers up to 30% more true predictors than SNP-by-SNP association testing.

A stringent significance threshold is required to identify robust genetic associations. Leveraging relevant auxiliary covariates has the potential to boost statistical power to exceed the significance threshold.

The accuracy of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to predict complex diseases increases with the training sample size. PRSs are generally derived based on summary statistics from large meta-analyses of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWASs) It is now common for researchers to have access to large individual-level data as well as the UK Biobank data.

CliP (Correlated Liability Predictors) is a method to detect heterogeneity in single GWAS cohorts. It calculates a weighted sum of correlations between SNPs contributing to a PRS on the case/control liability scale. We apply CLiP to heterogeneity detection in schizophrenia cohorts totaling > 50, 000 cases and controls.

 genetic predisposition for complex traits often acts through multiple tissues at different time points during development. Here we describe a statistical approach that leverages tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) corresponding to tissue- specific genes. We show that our approach can predict the relevant tissue accurately and can cluster individuals according to their tissue- Specific genetic architecture.

There is increasing evidence that many risk loci found using genome-wide association studies are molecular quantitative trait loci. Here we introduce a new set of functional annotations based on causal posterior probabilities of fine-mapped molecular cis-QTLs. We show that these annotations are more strongly enriched for heritability across 41 diseases and complex traits.

The large majority of variants identified by GWAS are non-coding. Existing high-throughput computational predictors have lacked large gold standard sets of regulatory variants for training and validation. Here, we leverage a set of 14,807 putative causal eQTLs in humans. We use 6121 features to directly train a predictor of whether a variant modifies nearby gene expression.

The consequences of duplication of the same genomic region have not been systematically assessed in large or adult samples.

In clinical applications, using erroneous segmentations of medical images can have dramatic consequences. Current approaches dedicated to medical image segmentation automatic quality control do not predict segmentation quality at slice-level (2D), resulting in sub-optimal evaluations. Our 2D-based deep learning method simultaneously performs quality control at 2D and 3D levels for cardiovascular MR image segmentations.

Rare monogenic disorders of the primary cilium, termed ciliopathies, are characterized by extreme presentations of otherwise common diseases. We performed association studies of 16,874 common genetic variants across 122 ciliary genes. 101 statistically significant associations were identified across 42 of the 122 examined ciliopathy genes.

There is evidence that lower height is associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) It is not clear though whether these associations are causal, direct or mediated by other factors. Here we show that one standard deviation higher genetically determined height (~6.5 cm) is causally associated with 16% decrease in CAD risk. We observe no direct causal effect of height on the risk of T2D.

Recent analyses have shown educational attainment to be associated with a number of health outcomes. This association may, in part, be due to an effect of educational attainment on smoking behaviour. In this study, we apply a multivariable Mendelian randomisation design to determine whether the effect is due to educational attainment or general cognitive ability.

Mitochondrial genome copy number (MT-CN) varies among humans and across tissues and is highly heritable. When measured by bulk DNA sequencing in blood, MT-CN may reflect a combination of the number of mitochondria per cell and cell-type composition. Using a Mendelian randomization framework, we show evidence that MT- CN measured in blood is causally related to insulin levels.

The prognosis for most patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is poor.

Here, we introduce a computationally efficient approach to estimate the genetic correlation between a large number of phenotypes simultaneously.

Whole brain estimation of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) is critical to get insight on the global status of the neurovascular coupling of an individual in healthy or pathological condition. Most of existing approaches in the literature works on task-fMRI data and relies on the experimental paradigm as a surrogate of neural activity.

Genetic evidence of disease association has often been used as a basis for selecting of drug targets for complex common diseases. The propagation of genetic evidence through gene or protein interaction networks has been shown to accurately infer novel disease associations at genes for which no direct genetic evidence can be observed. An empirical test of the utility of combining these approaches for drug discovery has been lacking.

One region suggested to play a key role in the pathophysiology of obesity is the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) We performed a meta-analysis of findings regarding NAcc volume and overweight/obesity. We additionally examined whether grey matter volume in the NAcc and other mesolimbic areas depends on the longitudinal trajectory of obesity.

We used data from the UK Biobank to assess the risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with various anthropometric measures in women and men. A higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and waist- to-height ratio were each associated with a greater risk of death in both sexes. The relative effects of a higher BMI on COVID19 mortality may be stronger in women than men.

Obesity has been associated with increased risk of accelerated cognitive decline and dementia, which suggests underlying neurobiological changes.

Current consensus is to combine a functional measure with muscle quantity to assess/confirm sarcopenia. However, the proper body size adjustment for muscle quantity is debated. Further, functional measures are not muscle-specific or sensitive to etiology. For effective detection/treatment/follow-up, muscle- specific biomarkers linked to function are needed.

We investigate the behavior of the Lasso for selecting invalid instruments in linear instrumental variables models. Invalid instruments are such that they fail the exclusion restriction and enter the model as explanatory variables. We propose a median estimator that is consistent when less than 50% of the instruments are invalid. This estimator can be used for adaptive Lasso estimation.

Quantitative traits analyzed in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are often nonnormally distributed. For such traits, association tests based on standard linear regression are subject to reduced power and inflated type I error in finite samples. Applying the rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) has become common practice in GWAS.

In 37 286 humans from the UK Biobank, resting-state functional connectivities of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), especially with the anterior cingulate cortex, were positively correlated with the liking for sweet foods.

Many phenotypes more naturally take ordered, discrete values. Dichotomizing can lead to a range of arbitrary cutoff values, generating inconsistent, hard to interpret results. Using multinomial regression ignores trait value hierarchy and potentially loses power. This approach increases power and leads to more interpretable results.

Parent-of-origin effects (POE) exist when there is differential expression of alleles inherited from the two parents. A genome-wide scan for POE on DNA methylation in 5,101 individuals identifies 733 independent methylation CpGs potentially influenced by POE. Methylation variation at 14 of the POE-influenced CpGS is associated with multiple metabolic traits.

Human longevity is moderately heritable and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding its relationship with brain aging.

Single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic risk score (GRS) has been developed and validated for prostate cancer (PCa) risk assessment. As GRS is population standardized, its value can be interpreted as a relative risk to the general population. A prospective cohort was derived from the UK Biobank where 208 685 PCa diagnosis-free participants were followed.

Perinatal light may imprint the circadian timing system, subsequently affect later life physiology, and possibly disease risk. We combined individual time-of-year of birth and corresponding latitude to determine perinatal photoperiod characteristics for UK Biobank participants. Increased 3 rd  trimester relative range was associated with decreased odds of DM (OR 0.63 95%CI 0.49-0.81) in the NEP group.

Walking an additional 2,500 steps per day was associated with 44% reduction in liver disease progression.

Physical activity (PA) is recommended as one of the main lifestyle behaviours. We assessed the benefits of PA on mortality and life expectancy in people with and without multimorbidity. Leisure-time PA and total PA were measured by questionnaire.

It is unclear what combinations of physical capability markers used to define sarcopenia have the strongest associations with health outcomes. 469,830 UK Biobank participants were included in this prospective study. Outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, as well as incidence and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Mean Platelet Volume (MPV), a cell trait partially associated with markers of platelet activity, is more commonly available. We investigated the association of metabolic syndrome and diabetes with platelet aggregation to three physiological agonists, ADP, collagen, and epinephrine, in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. After a median of 18.1 years follow-up, no Platelet aggregation trait was associated with increased risk of diabetes ( n  = 344 cases).

Osteoporosis and obesity are two severe complex diseases threatening public health worldwide. Both diseases are under strong genetic determinants as well as genetically correlated. We identified one novel locus, 17q21.31, which may have pleiotropic effects to both hip BMD and TBFM. KIF18B, C1QL1, and PRPF19 were highlighted as candidate genes.

We identified 2 novel loci at 2q37.1 and 6q26 for bone mineral density and bone size. Findings provide insight into common genetic architecture underlying both traits.

 Epilepsy is clinically heterogeneous, and neurological or psychiatric comorbidities are frequently observed in patients. It has not been tested whether common risk variants for generalized or focal epilepsy are enriched in people with other disorders or traits related to brain or cognitive function. Here, we perform two brain-focused phenome association studies of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for generalized epilepsy and focal epilepsy for 334,310 European-ancestry individuals of the UK Biobank.

We analyzed the genomic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity using magnetic resonance imaging and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.

Polygenic scores (PGS) for eight common diseases, disorders, or traits, including psychiatric disorders, were calculated in 274 participants (125 mood disorder cases) who each reported three or four grandparents born in the community. Ancestry-matched controls were selected from the UK Biobank (UKB; three sets of N = 1,822 each) The mean PGSs were significantly higher in the U.S. community for major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The results are consistent with enrichment of polygenic risk factors for psychiatric disorders in this community.

Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) from a European-ancestry genome-wide association study in generalized and focal epilepsy, we quantified common genetic burden. Across 8386 patients with epilepsy and 622 212 population controls, we found and replicated significantly higher GE-PRS in patients with generalized epilepsy compared to patients with focal epilepsy. European ancestry-derived PRS did not predict generalized epilepsy or focal epilepsy in Japanese-ANCestry individuals.

We examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for consumption and problem subscales of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C, AUDIT-P) in the UK Biobank (UKB; N = 121 630) correlate with alcohol outcomes in four independent samples. In COGA, AUDit-P PRS was associated with alcohol dependence, AUD symptom count, maximum drinks, and increased likelihood of onset of alcohol dependence.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) provide an opportunity to understand risk factors since they reflect etiologic pathways from the entire genome. We tested the association of a CHD PRS with CHD and its traditional clinical risk factors amongst individuals with type 2 diabetes in UK Biobank.

Research has shown differences in subcortical brain volumes between participants with schizophrenia and healthy controls. None of these differences have been found to associate with schizophrenia polygenic risk. In a large sample (n = 14,701) of unaffected participants from the UK Biobank, we test whether schizophreniapolygenic risk scores (PRS) are limited to specific gene-sets. We compare associations with schizophrenia PRS at the whole genome level.

Polygenic risk models have led to significant advances in understanding complex diseases and their clinical presentation. While polygenic risk scores (PRS) can effectively predict outcomes, they do not generally account for disease subtypes or pathways which underlie within-trait diversity. Here, we introduce a latent factor model of genetic risk based on components from Decomposition of Genetic Associations (DeGAs)

Few prospective studies have evaluated the relation between fat-soluble vitamins and glioma risk. In 346,785 participants (444 cases) in UKB, associations with vitamin D were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards regression. In NHS (52 cases, 104 controls) and HPFS (32 cases, 64 controls), associations with 25(OH)D, vitamin A (retinol), and vitamin E were assessed using conditional logistic regression. Nonsignificant associations were observed for &#945;-tocopherol.

A model was trained on 84,743 retinal fundus photos from the UK Biobank dataset. The model performed significantly worse when foveal pathology was present in the external validation dataset.

Study looked at risk of cancer for 367,703 individuals in the UK Biobank. Variants in the HMGCR gene region were associated with overall cancer risk. But variants in gene regions representing alternative lipid-lowering treatment targets were not. This suggests that statins reduce cancer risk through a cholesterol independent pathway.

Study aimed to determine whether risk prediction based on common genetic variants might enable stratification for CRC risk. Meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies comprising 16 871 cases and 26 328 controls was performed. A weighted PRS of 116 CRC single nucleotide polymorphisms was found with the best predictive performance.

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be older and frequently have hypertension, diabetes, or coronary heart disease. Preexisting diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors. Chronic kidney disease and asthma were risk factors for hospitalization in women but not men.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease of unknown origin, has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Individuals with mental disorders may have a higher risk of infection and worse clinical outcomes because of a variety of factors such as poorer general resilience and lower immune function.

Poorer performance on standard tests of pre-morbid cognitive function is related to an elevated risk of death from lower respiratory tract infections. But the link with coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality is untested. Participants in UK Biobank, aged 40 to 69 years at study induction (2006-10), were administered a reaction time test.

 Essential fructosuria (EF) is a benign, asymptomatic, autosomal recessive condition caused by loss-of-function variants in the ketohexokinase gene.

The relationship between natural selection and phenotypic variation has been a long-standing challenge in human population genetics. We calculated a per-individual deleterious load score by summing the total number of derived alleles per individual after incorporating a weight that approximates strength of purifying selection. The load score amongst coding sites had an excess of nominally significant associations on many medical phenotypes.

Hypertension-associated cardiovascular events are particularly associated with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) in late life.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool for understanding population structure and controlling for population stratification in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) There is a need for methods that can compute principal components (PCs) with scalable computational and memory requirements. We present ProPCA, a highly scalable method based on a probabilistic generative model, which computes the top PCs on genetic variation data efficiently.

Seasonal disease outbreaks are perennial features of human infectious disease. The factors generating these patterns are unclear. Here we investigate seasonal and daytime variability in multiple immune parameters in 329,261 participants in UK Biobank.

Shift work is associated with increased cardiometabolic disease risk. This observation may be partly explained by cardiometric risk factors having a role in the selection of individuals into or out of shift work. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in the UK Biobank (UKB) to test this hypothesis. Liability to lower educational attainment and higher BMI may influence selection into shift work, but sleep timing preference did not.

The spatial signals in neuroimaging mass univariate analyses can be characterized in a number of ways. Peak locations and magnitudes provide a useful summary of activation. The magnitudes reflect selection bias as these points have both survived a threshold and are local maxima. We propose the use of resampling methods to estimate and correct this bias.

Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is very common in older adults and has major impact on quality of life. The heritability of ARHI has been estimated to be around 50%. The present study aimed to estimate heritability and environmental contributions to liability of AR HI.

Poor sleep is associated with multiple age-related neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. The hippocampus plays a special role in sleep and sleep-dependent cognition. accelerated hippocampal atrophy is typically seen with higher age. It is critical to establish how relationship between sleep and hippocampal volume loss unfolds across the adult lifespan.

Sex difference in the effect of raised BP was consistent for dementia subtypes (vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease)

A total of 471,971 UK Biobank participants without a history of cardiovascular disease were included. During 9 years of follow-up, 4,662 (44% women) cases of stroke were recorded. Hypertension, smoking, and a low socioeconomic status were associated with a greater HR of any stroke in women than men.

 type 2 diabetes is a stronger risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in women compared with men. However, it is not clear whether this reflects a sex differential in the causal effect of diabetes on CHD risk or results from sex-specific residual confounding. We performed a sex-stratified Mendelian randomization (MR) study using individual participant data in UK Biobank.

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) has been reported to be a risk factor associated with the development of arthritis. This study aimed to determine whether the concentrations of circulating SHBG are causally associated with risk of OA, RA, and AS.

We examined associations of serum total testosterone (TT) and free testosterone (FT) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in 154 965 men and 93 314 postmenopausal women from UK Biobank.

Elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke (IS), and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) Studies investigating the association between Lp('a') levels and these diseases in women have yielded inconsistent results. To investigate the association of Lp'a' with sex-specific cardiovascular outcomes, we determined the association using individual participant data from the UK Biobank.

Insulin resistance may have sex-specific effects on the reproductive axis. Impaired kidney function may also cause insulin resistance. We assessed these possibilities using bi-directional, sex- specific, two-sample Mendelian randomisation.

Genetically predicted insulin is positively associated with ischemic heart disease. Sex differences are unclear, despite different disease rates and reproductive strategies by sex. Mitigating the effects of insulin might address sexual disparities in health.

 Meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) may clarify the associations of smoking, blood cells and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) We investigated the association of smoking with blood cells in the Danish General Suburban Population Study (GESUS, n = 11 083) and MR of smoking variant CHRNA3 (rs1051730[A]) in UK Biobank. Smoking is observationally and genetically associated with increased leukocyte counts and red blood cell indices (MCH, MCV, RDW) and observationally with risk of MPN.

Whether smoking-associated DNA methylation has a causal effect on lung function has not been thoroughly evaluated. We first investigated the causal effects of 474 smoking- associated CpGs on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) in UK Biobank (n = 321,047) and then replicated this investigation in the SpiroMeta Consortium. By using "moloc", we found evidence of shared causal variants between lung function, gene expression, and DNA methylated. These findings highlight potential therapeutic targets for improving lung function and possibly smoking cessation.

Of 472 946 participants alive when COVID-19 was first apparent in the UK, 217 (34% women) died from the disease over the next 10 months. Greater social deprivation, quantified using the Townsend Deprivation Score, was associated with greater risk of fatal COVD-19.

We explored the role of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 incidence among cancer patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Compared with the least deprived cancer patients, those living in the most deprived areas had an almost three times higher risk of testing positive. This socio-demographic profiling of vulnerable cancer patients at increased risk of infection can inform prevention strategies and policy improvements for the coming pandemic waves.

We identified 208 independent lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) mapping to 69 loci associated with T1D.

Brain structural networks have been shown to consistently organize in functionally meaningful architectures covering the entire brain. To what extent brain structural architectures match the intrinsic functional networks in different functional domains remains under explored. In this study, based on independent component analysis, we revealed 45 pairs of structural-functional (S-F) component maps.

 associations between indices of brain structure and measured intelligence are unclear. This is partly because the evidence to-date comes from mostly small and heterogeneous studies. Here, we report brain structure-intelligence associations on a large sample from the UK Biobank study.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with an increased risk for left ventricular and right ventricular dysfunction. Most studies to date have examined populations with manifest cardiovascular disease using echocardiography. Our aim was to explore these parameters with cardiac MRI. We analyzed cardiac MRI data from 4978 UK Biobank participants free from cardiovascular disease.

ChREBP (carbohydrate responsive element binding protein) is a transcription factor that responds to sugar consumption. Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and genetic variants in the CHREBP locus have separately been linked to HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and triglyceride concentrations. We hypothesized that SSB consumption would modify the association between genetic variants and dyslipidemia.

Identifying genetic biomarkers for brain connectivity helps us understand genetic effects on brain function. The challenge in detecting associations between brain connectivity and genetic variants is that the phenotype is a matrix rather than a scalar. We study a new concept of super-variant for genetic association detection.

A supervariant is a combination of alleles in multiple loci, but the contributing loci can be anywhere in the genome. We hypothesize that supervariants are easy to detect and the aggregated signals are more stable in their associations with the disease.

The prediction performance of Cox proportional hazard model suffers when there are only few uncensored events in the training data. This scenario is common in the UK Biobank dataset. By analyzing these responses together, we hope to achieve higher prediction performance than when they are analyzed individually.

Cross-sectional study consisted of 25 261 self-reported White UK Biobank participants with major depression. Four broad symptom dimensions were identified, encompassing negative cognition, functional impairment, insomnia and atypical symptoms. Every dimension was associated with increased risk of nearly every psychiatric diagnosis and polygenic risk score.

Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent and comorbid psychiatric traits that cause considerable burden worldwide. We use factor analysis and genomic structural equation modelling to investigate the genetic factor structure underlying 28 items assessing depression, anxiety and neuroticism. Symptoms of depression and anxiety loaded on two distinct, although highly genetically correlated factors.

Recent work has shown that polygenic scores have limited portability across groups of different genetic ancestries. This restricts the contexts in which they can be used reliably and potentially creating serious inequities in future clinical applications. Using the UK Biobank data, we demonstrate that even within a single ancestry group, prediction accuracy can depend on characteristics.

Existing gene-environment interaction (G Ã— E) tests for rare variants largely focus on detecting gene-based G Ã— E effects in a single study. Meta-analysis methods that synthesize summary statistics of GÃ—E effects from multiple studies are still limited.

This study provides a theoretical model to evaluate how physical activity (PA) and sunlight exposure influence serum vitamin D and regional adiposity.

Normative modelling is becoming more popular in neuroimaging due to its ability to make predictions of deviation from a normal trajectory at the level of individual participants. So far, most normative modelling approaches used Gaussian process regression, and although suitable for smaller datasets, it does not scale well to the large cohorts currently available and being acquired.

Biomedical repositories such as the UK Biobank provide increasing access to prospectively collected cardiac imaging. These data are unlabeled, which creates barriers to their use in supervised machine learning.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) were studied in the UK Biobank. Regular PPIs use was associated with a higher risk of ASCVD and every subtype of the disease.

Sex differences in the fitness effects of genetic variants can influence the rate of adaptation and the maintenance of genetic variation. For example, "sexually antagonistic" (SA) variants can both constrain adaptation and increase genetic variability for fitness components such as survival, fertility, and disease susceptibility. detecting variants with sex-differential fitness effects is difficult.

 Complex brain networks play a central role in integrating activity across the human brain. Such networks can be identified in the absence of any external stimulus. We found that the heritability of global network efficiency was largely explained by blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) resting state fluctuation amplitudes (RSFA)

l-carnitine is emerging as an item of interest for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and treatment, but controversy exists. We assessed how genetically different levels of l-c Carnitine are associated with CVD risk and its risk factors. Given higher CVD incidence in men, we also examined sex-specific associations.

Sex is seldom considered as a potential moderator of the impact of bipolar disorder (BD) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We aimed to characterize the sex-specific association of CVD and BD using data from the UK Biobank. We found a two- to three-fold stronger association among women than among men.

Performance of the proposed methods is evaluated empirically based on Monte-Carlo simulations and real-data application.

Average and slow walking pace was associated with a higher risk of incident T2D in both men and women, independent of major confounding factors. Compared with slow walkers, brisk walkers have the same diabetes incidence rate 18.6 and 16.0 years later.

Exposure polygenic risk scores (ExPRS) offer an alternative to study the influence of exposures on various phenotypes. We established ExPRSs for 27 exposures and demonstrated their applicability in phenome-wide association studies and as predictors for common chronic conditions.

Both walking pace and genetic risk were strongly associated with CAD. The absolute 10-year risk of CAD was highest in slow walkers at high genetic risk (top 20% of PGS)

Of 377,909 UK Biobank participants having European ancestry, 3,210 (0.8%) died due to CV disease during a median follow-up of 8.9 years. CV mortality risk was significantly associated with CAD PRS and T2DM PRS. There was no evidence of significant interaction between PRSs and age, sex, or lifestyle behavior in predicting the risk of CV mortality.

Latent class analysis detected groups of middle-aged individuals clustering by cardiometabolic health.

In those aged >60 years, negative associations of age were greater in the class comprising healthier older women.

We investigated the dynamics of the relationship between SHBG, total testosterone (total-T), and body mass index (BMI) throughout puberty. The directionality of this relationship was explored using polygenic scores of SHBG and total-T. Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (in male adults) showed the effect of BMI on SHBG but no effect of SH BG on BMI. These results shed new light on their possible relationship with obesity.

A total of 440,693 white European (55.9% women), 7305 South Asian (48.6%) and 7628 black African or Caribbean (57.7%) people were included from UK Biobank.

For South Asian people, the cardiovascular hazard ratio (HR) compared to white European people was 1.28 (99% CI [1.16, 1.43]

 MR-GxE requires an interaction to be explicitly identified, while MR-GENIUS does not. We find both approaches share similar assumptions, though differences between the approaches lend themselves to differing research settings. We explore the effect of body mass index (BMI) upon systolic blood pressure using data from the UK Biobank.

Lung cancer incidence (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-1.76) increased among participants with  in utero  tobacco exposure.

A higher genetically predicted eGFR was significantly associated with higher lymphocyte percentage, HDL cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase.

Mendelian Randomisation (MR) can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding. Multivariable MR (MVMR) allows for multiple, potentially highly related, exposures to be included in an MR estimation. MVMR estimates the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome conditional on all the other exposures included in the estimation.

We apply our model to polygenic scores of educational attainment and birth weight associated variants, in up to 5,178 adopted singletons.

The recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is threatening global health. An understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells is still lacking. We identified six nonsense and missense variants of hACE2 from 2585 subjects in the UK Biobank covering 500000 individuals.

Estimating effects of parental and sibling genotypes (indirect genetic effects) can provide insight into how the family environment influences phenotypic variation. We used UK Biobank data to estimate polygenic score (PGS) associations for height, BMI and educational attainment in self-reported singletons and non-singletons. We estimate that a 1 SD increase in sibling educational attainment PGS corresponds to a 0.025 year increase in the index individual's school years.

Accurate 3D modelling of cardiac chambers is essential for clinical assessment of cardiac volume and function, including structural, and motion analysis. To study the correlation between cardiac morphology and other patient information within a large population, it is necessary to automatically generate cardiac mesh models of each subject within the population. In this study, we introduce MCSI-Net (Multi-Cue Shape Inference Network), where we embed a statistical shape model inside a convolutional neural network.

We performed the HyPrColoc colocalization analysis to detect possible shared causal genes between dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 5 selected traits: stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cholesterol level, and alcohol consumption. Rs150562240 in the LPIN3 gene was identified as a candidate shared causal variant across dementia, AD and Atherosclerosis.

We present a graph embedded topic model (GETM) We integrate existing biomedical knowledge graph information in the form of pre-trained graph embedding. GETM-inferred phenotypes not only accurately predict the status of chronic musculoskeletal (CMK) pain but also reveal known pain-related topics.

Transition from acute to chronic pain is critically important but not well understood. We found thousands of dynamic transcriptional changes over 3 months in LBP participants with resolved pain but none in those with persistent pain. Transient neutrophil-driven up-regulation of inflammatory responses was protective against the transition to chronicPain.

For many complex phenotypes, the assumptions of the linear regression models are not always met. We compared the prediction accuracy of the neural network models to that of classical approaches based on linear regression. The models performed similarly unless the observed distribution of the phenotype was skewed, in which case the neural networks had smaller mean squared error.

Pathological brain appearances may be so heterogeneous as to be intelligible only as anomalies. Detecting such anomalies requires models of the normal brain that combine compactness and expressivity. We combine the latent representation of vector quantised variational autoencoders with an ensemble of autoregressive transformers to enable unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation.

The molecular determinants of tissue composition of the human brain remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on this topic have had limited success due to methodological constraints. Key molecular pathways involved in axonal growth, astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation and synaptogenesis during development are found to significantly impact the measured variations in tissue-specific imaging features.

Chronic pain was associated with hospital admission for CO VID-19 even after adjustment for all covariates.

With the advent of high throughput genetic data, there have been attempts to estimate heritability from genome-wide SNP data. Fitting such an LMM in a large scale cohort study is tremendously challenging due to its high dimensional linear algebraic operations. PredLMM has substantially better computational complexity than most of the existing LMM based methods and thus, provides a fast alternative for estimating heritability.

Heritability is a fundamental concept in genetic studies, measuring the genetic contribution to complex traits. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSC) estimates both heritability and confounding biases, such as cryptic relatedness and population stratification. We propose LD eigenvalue regression (LDER), an extension of LDSC, by making full use of the LD information.

Two recently reported neuroanatomical signatures of schizophrenia-signature 1, with widespread reduction of gray matter volume, and signature 2, with increased striatal volume-were replicated. Authors compared cognition, psychopathology, and polygenic risk between signatures. Signature 1 was associated with worse cognitive performance than signature 2.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the joints. Diet can represent both a risk factor and a protective factor. Oily fish, alcohol, coffee and breakfast cereals have protective roles in RA.

PolyPred combines two predictors: a new predictor that leverages functionally informed fine-mapping to estimate causal effects (instead of tagging effects) and BOLT-LMM, a published predictor. We applied PolyPred to 49 diseases/traits in four UK Biobank populations and observed relative improvements ranging from +7% in south Asians to +32% in Africans. We propose PolyPred+ which further incorporates the non-European training data.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is unknown, and relevant mortality predictors are lacking. De-identified data from 113,882 were collected from the UK Biobank.

Sleep behaviors, including chronotype, sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, and daytime sleepiness were used to construct a healthy sleep score. We also derived a healthy lifestyle score based on smoking status, diet quality, physical activity, and body mass index.

Since 2005, genome-wide association (GWA) datasets have been largely biased toward sampling European ancestry individuals. Recent studies have shown that GWA results estimated from self-identified European individuals are not transferable to non-European individuals. We demonstrate that enrichment analyses that aggregate SNP-level association statistics at multiple genomic scales can generate biologically interpretable hypotheses.

Many studies on prostate cancer (PCa) germline variants have been published in the last 15 years. SNP-based GRS and RPMs in four genes were significantly and consistently associated with PCa risk in large well-designed studies. Prospective studies evaluating the performance of all three inherited measures in predicting PCa detection rate from contemporary multiparametric MRI are lacking.

Inferring the structure of human populations from genetic variation data is a key task in population and medical genomic studies. Current methods are impractical to run on biobank-scale genomic datasets containing millions of individuals. SCOPE infers population structure in about a day on a dataset containing one million individuals and variants.

 Frailty is common in early and established RA and associated with hospitalisation and mortality. Frailty in RA is dynamic and, for some, may be ameliorated through controlling disease activity in early disease.

A lack of physical activity (PA) is one of the most pressing health issues today. Our individual propensity for PA is influenced by genetic factors. Stated liking of different PA types may help capture additional and informative dimensions of PA behavior genetics.

Over 4.2 million person-years, 4270 dementia cases occurred in 351,436 UK Biobank participants. Wine intake showed a significant U-shaped association with the lowest risk for incident dementia. In contrast, non-wine is positively related to dementia risk in a linear fashion. No clear association is found for coffee.

Between 2006 and 2010, a total of 341,331 participants (age 37-73 years) in the UK Biobank were examined and thereafter followed up to 2020. The CVH raised by the AHA included 4 behavioral (smoking, diet, physical activity, body mass index) and 3 biological (fasting glucose, blood cholesterol, blood pressure) metrics.

The ability to accurately predict an individual's risk for cancer is critical to the implementation of precision prevention measures. Current cancer risk predictions are frequently made with simple models that use a few proven risk factors, such as the Gail model for breast cancer.

A high healthy lifestyle index (HLI) is a composite score based on good diet quality, low alcohol consumption, no smoking, moderate to high physical activity, and waist circumference. In postmenopausal women, compared with a low HLI, higher scores were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.

Biobanks linked to massive, longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data make numerous new genetic research questions feasible. High blood pressure measurements over visits strongly predict stroke onset, and consistently high fasting glucose and Hb1Ac levels define diabetes.

Sex-specific differences have been noted among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether these differences are attributable to genetic variation is poorly understood. The availability of large biobanks with deeply phenotyped subjects such as the UK Biobank enables the investigation of sex-specific genetic associations.

A polygenic risk score estimates the genetic risk of an individual for some disease or trait. It is calculated by aggregating the effect of many common variants associated with the condition. With the increasing availability of genetic data in large cohort studies such as the UK Biobank, inclusion of this genetic risk is becoming more widespread.

A selection of state-of-the-art approaches were assessed. Different methods were also applied to a section of the UK biobank cohort for Atrial Fibrillation. PLINK's implementation of BOOST recovered the highest number of correct interactions.

There is a paucity of epidemiological evidence on alcohol and the risk of bradyarrhythmias. We studied 407 948 middle-aged individuals (52.4% female) over a median follow-up time of 11.5 years. Increasing total alcohol consumption was not associated with an increased risk. Beer and cider intake were associated with increased brady arrhythmia risk up to 12 drinks/week.

Cardiometabolic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite a known genetic component, our understanding of these diseases remains incomplete. We analyzed data from 200,337 UK Biobank participants with whole-exome sequencing. There was a striking risk associated with mutations in known Mendelian disease genes.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of all death globally. Timely and accurate identification of people at risk of developing an atherosclerotic CVD and its sequelae is a central pillar of preventive cardiology. One widely used approach is risk prediction models.

Drug development and biological discovery require effective strategies to map existing genetic associations to causal genes. We selected 12 common diseases and quantitative traits for which highly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were available. We found that positive control genes were highly enriched in proximity to GWAS-associated single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)

Physical activity (PA) is recognized as one of the key lifestyle behaviors that reduces risk of developing dementia late in life. However, PA also leads to increased respiration, and in areas with high levels of air pollution, PA may increase exposure to pollutants linked with higher risk of dementia. Here, we investigate whether air pollution attenuates the association between PA and dementia risk.

The fibrous annulus of the mitral valve plays an important role in valvular function and cardiac physiology.

Whether ORA I1 itself is associated with an increased risk for severe CoV-19 presentation is still unknown.

Among 449,595 participants, 22,338 (5.0%) were diagnosed with IBS. During a median of 12.2-year follow-up, 2,937 cases of incident cancer were identified in patients with Ibs. Compared with non-IBS, the adjusted hazard ratio for overall cancer and cancer-specific mortality was 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-1.00, P = 0.062)

Heritability of a trait is measured as the proportion of total variance explained by the additive effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. Heritability is usually estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood or method of moments approaches such as Haseman-Elston regression. Our proposed method is computationally scalable on biobank datasets and gives an asymptotically unbiased estimate of heritability in presence of discrete substructures.

Large-scale prospective cohort study included 370,671 participants without CKD at baseline. Five sleep behaviors were made up of sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, chronotype, and daytime sleepiness. 17.1% of CKD in this cohort could be attributed to total poor sleep pattern.

Longer sleep was positively associated with lung cancer risk compared with normal sleep duration. Frequent insomnia symptoms increased the risk of lung cancer compared with never/rarely experiencing symptoms. In analysis excluding participants reporting shift work at baseline, evening chronotypes were at a greater risk.

UK Biobank (UKB) is widely employed to investigate mental health disorders and related exposures. We present the first validation study using secondary care mental health data with linkage to UKB from Oxford - Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV, proportion of true positives cases detected) for mental health diagnosis and relevant medication.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are valuable to translate the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into clinical practice. To date, most GWAS have been based on individuals of European-ancestry leading to poor performance in populations of non-European ancestry. We introduce the polygenic transcriptome risk score (PTRS), which is based on predicted transcript levels (rather than SNPs) and explore the portability of PTRS across populations.

The algorithm was trained on retinal images from 50,077 UK Biobank participants and tested on 12,185 participants. The addition of the algorithm to the TRFs model improved risk stratification with an overall NRI of 50.8%. Our results demonstrate that this deep learning algorithm can be a useful tool for stratifying individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes in the general population.

In a simulated panel with 4000 haplotypes and a 0.2% error rate, we show it can reliably correct 85% of errors. We also showed that PS-cluster is adequately efficient for UK Biobank data.

There is growing interest in the clinical application of polygenic scores as their predictive utility increases for a range of health-related phenotypes. However, providing polygenic score predictions on the absolute scale is an important step for their safe interpretation. We have developed a method to convertpolygenic scores to theabsolute scale for binary and normally distributed phenotypes using summary statistics.

We compared EDP to the Quantile Regression Index (QRI; a linear alternative to the brain age metric)

A healthy sleep pattern is characterized by sleep of 7 to 8 h/d, no insomnia, no frequent snoring, and no daytime sleepiness. We included 392,218 European adults, aged 38 to 73 years, who were free of CKD at recruitment between March 13, 2006, and October 1, 2010.

There is little evidence on how factors relatively affect physical activity (PA) Using a socioecological approach, it was discovered that obesity and disease-related factors were the most important determinants. PCs related to body composition and chronic diseases were suggested as key determinants of objectively measured MVPA.

Prior studies have established that higher educational attainment is associated with a longer telomere length (TL), a marker of cellular aging. However, it is unclear whether extant associations are causal, since they are likely confounded by unobserved genetic, early-life and family background factors. We leverage sibling differences in TL, education and measured genetics to estimate associations between educational attainment and TL in midlife.

Outliers have usually been detected in a supervised or semi-supervised manner for labeled neuroimaging cohorts. There has been much less work using unsupervised outlier detection on large unlabeled cohorts like the UK Biobank brain imaging dataset. Given its large sample size, rare imaging phenotypes within this unique cohort are of interest.

One of the most commonly studied loci is the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter polymorphism. The genetic association signals between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric phenotypes have been inconsistent across many studies. We developed a GWAS summary-statistics-based approach for testing the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) associations with various phenotypes.

 Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) incorporated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) cohorts as a reference panel.

Left atrial (LA) structure and function with prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of left ventricular (LV) metrics, in 25 896 UK Biobank participants. Lower LAEF was associated with diabetes, smoking, and all the prevalent and incidents CVDs. Diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol were associated with smaller LAV. Hypertension, IHD, AF (incident and prevalent), incident stroke, and CVD mortality were associated.

People from Black African, Black Caribbean and Indian groups were less likely to report hearing difficulty than their White British or Irish counterparts. For equivalent levels of hearing loss, the use of hearing aids is lower among ethnic minority groups. Inequalities are partly due to lower levels of self-reported hearing difficulty among minorities.

A significant proportion of patients with elevated LDL do not carry known genetic mutations associated with hypercholesterolemia, such as defects in the LDL receptor. To identify new genes involved in the cellular uptake of LDL, we developed a novel whole-genome clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9 KO screen in HepG2 cells. We identified transgelin ( TAGLN), an actin-binding protein, as a potentially new gene involved in LDL endocytosis.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) has been associated with cognitive function and neuropsychiatric outcomes in humans. In this study, we sought to further generalize previously reported associations of cognitive function with the virus. The results of adjusted linear regression models showed no associations with reasoning, pairs-matching, or reaction-time cognitive tasks or with depression.

Brain structure, psychosocial, and physical factors underpin back pain conditions. Less is known about how these factors differ based on pain duration and location. We found differences in structural brain measures in the chronic pain groups alone.

The number of variants that have a non-zero effect on a trait is a fundamental parameter in the study of the genetic architecture of a complex trait. Although many previous studies have investigated polygenicity at a genome-wide scale, a detailed understanding of how it varies across genomic regions is currently lacking. In this work, we propose an accurate and scalable statistical framework to estimate regionalpolygenicity for acomplex trait.

Behavioral disinhibition is observed to be an important characteristic of many neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have linked dietary quality to levels of behavioral inhibition. It is currently unclear whether brain factors might mediate this. The current study investigates whether cortical and subcortical brain volumes mediate part of the association.

Psychosis is associated with many forms of adversity, deprivation and living in urban areas. We sought to understand mechanisms by which childhood, recent/contemporary and place-based adversities might cluster and interact.

Cumulative dietary risk factors were represented using a score ranging from 0 (healthiest) to 9 (least healthy) This was derived from 9 food items based on current UK guidelines. Follow-up was conducted until June 2020 for mortality, and for incidence, up to June 2020 in England.

Meaning in life is associated consistently with greater self-reported physical activity. Participants between the ages of 40 and 70 years old from the UK Biobank wore an accelerometer for up to seven days and reported on their meaning in life. Higher meaning was associated with greater engagement in physical activity, an association robust across age, gender, and education.

Sickle cell trait (SCT) carriers inherit one copy of the Glu6Val mutation in the hemoglobin gene. SCT carriers are particularly common in Black individuals (5-10%). Considering the roles of hemoglobin in immune responses and the higher risk for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among Black individuals, we tested whether Black S CT carriers were at increased risk for infection and mortality.

200 632 subjects who have undergone exome sequencing by the UK Biobank were investigated to identify any variants predicted to cause HIRA haploinsufficiency. Four were found, three with frameshift variants and one with a stop variant. One of these subjects had depression but the others did not have any major neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

Colocalization is a statistical method used in genetics to determine whether the same variant is causal for multiple phenotypes. Current colocalization methods require full summary statistics for both traits. We propose a new approximation to the popular coloc method that can be applied when limited summary statistics are available.

Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most prominent genetic predisposition to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. AAT plays important immunomodulatory and tissue-protective roles. It was suggested to protect from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces CRC incidence and mortality. It is unclear whether the reduction in CRC risk may differ by genetic susceptibility. We evaluated this question in a cohort of 304,740 participants of European descent aged 50 years and older.

Cigarette smoking and obesity pose a particular impairment to health. Genetic factors have been shown to influence both traits. We examined the observed and genetic relationship between adiposity and cigarettes smoked per day in a large sample of current, former, and never smokers.

Neanderthal DNA affects skin tone and hair color, height, sleeping patterns, mood, and smoking status in present-day Europeans. Multiple Neanderthal alleles at different loci contribute to skin and hair colour in current Europeans. This suggests that Neanderthals themselves were most likely variable in these traits.

Mendelian randomization and colocalization are two statistical approaches that can be applied to summarized data from genome-wide association studies. Despite similarities in scope, they are different in their objectives, implementation, and interpretation. In this review, we discuss how the two approaches can provide complementary information on potential therapeutic targets.

Identifying gene sets associated to disease can provide valuable biological knowledge. A fundamental challenge of gene set analyses of GWAS data is linking disease-associated SNPs to genes. We developed a method, gene co-regulation score (GCSC) regression, to identify gene sets that are enriched for disease heritability explained by predicted expression.

An important goal of clinical genomics is to estimate the risk of adverse disease outcomes. Between 5% and 10% of individuals with ulcerative colitis require colectomy within 5 years of diagnosis. By contrast, gene expression profiling of GWAS-significant genes provides some stratification of risk of progression to complicated disease.

Most methods for fast detection of identity by descent (IBD) segments report identity by state segments.

Recombination rates vary significantly across the genome. Estimates of recombination rates are needed for downstream analyses. Existing methods for recombination rate estimation are limited by insufficient amounts of informative genetic data or by high computational cost. We present a method and software, called IBDrecomb, for using segments of identity by descent to infer recombining rates.

In complex trait genetics, the ability to predict phenotype from genotype is the ultimate measure of our understanding of genetic architecture underlying the heritability of a trait. We propose a polygenic risk prediction method that does not require explicitly modeling any underlying genetic architecture. NPS improves the identification of groups at high risk for breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and coronary heart disease.

Bayesian model comparison approach called MRP (multiple rare variants and phenotypes) for rare-variant association studies. We apply our method to exome sequencing data (n = 184,698) across 2,019 traits from the UK Biobank. MRP demonstrates an ability to recover signals such as associations between PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels.

Theory and simulation study are used to demonstrate that widespread pleiotropy among phenotypes can be utilised to improve genomic risk prediction.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting human complex traits and diseases. We present PRS-CS, a polygenic prediction method that infers posterior effect sizes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using genome-wide association summary statistics and an external linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel. Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRs-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures.

X-linked causes have been hypothesised to underlie the higher developmental disorder rates in males. We evaluate the burden of X-linked coding variation in 11,044 developmental disorder patients. We identify 23 significant genes, all of which were previously known. We estimate that only 13% of inherited rare missense variants in known developmental disorder-associated genes are likely to be pathogenic.

Many human proteins contain domains that vary in size or copy number because of variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in protein-coding exons. The relationships of VN TRs to most phenotypes are unknown because of difficulties in measuring such repetitive elements. We developed methods to estimate VNTR lengths from whole-exome sequencing data and impute VnTR alleles into single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes.

People aged 40-69 years from the UK Biobank cohort and Korean National Health Insurance Service cohort were included in this observational cohort study.

Osteoporosis is an age-associated disease characterised by low bone mineral density (BMD) and micro-architectural deterioration leading to enhanced fracture risk. Conventional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis has facilitated our understanding of BMD reduction in specific regions of interest (ROIs) within the femur. A new technique, termed DXA region free analysis, is proposed to eliminate morphological variation between DXA scans.

UK Biobank recruited adults across England, Scotland and Wales, between March 2006 and July 2010.

Hair color is one of the most recognizable visual traits in European populations and is under strong genetic control. We identified 123 autosomal and one X-chromosome loci significantly associated with hair color; all but 13 are novel. These results confirm the polygenic nature of complex phenotypes and improve our understanding of melanin pigment metabolism in humans.

There is considerable interest in estimating the causal effect of a range of maternal environmental exposures on offspring health-related outcomes. Previous attempts to do this using Mendelian randomization methodologies have been hampered by the paucity of epidemiological cohorts with large numbers of mother-offspring pairs.

Identifying causal effects in nonexperimental data is an enduring challenge. Mendelian randomization (MR) is problematic because many variables of interest are genetically correlated. Here, we propose an alternative approach, genetic instrumental variable (GIV) regression. GIV regression uses polygenic scores (PGSs) for the outcome of interest.

The risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) is higher in wintertime. It is not known if this reflects annual changes in diet or lifestyle, or an endogenous photoperiodic mechanism that is sensitive to changes in day length. In this cross-sectional study, we report annual variations in cardiovascular risk factors and mortality that were associated with day length independent of environmental and lifestyle factors.

Diffusion MRI data can be affected by hardware and subject-related artefacts that can adversely affect downstream analyses. Automated quality control (QC) is of great importance, especially in large population studies where visual QC is not practical. We introduce an automated diffusion MRI QC framework for single subject and group studies.

Only seven methods could effectively control the type I error, and these well-calibrated approaches had varying power performance under the simulation scenarios. The burden test was generally underpowered and score-based variance component tests (e.g., sequence kernel association test) were much powerful under the polygenic genetic architecture.

Previous studies have often evaluated methods for Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis based on simulations that do not adequately reflect the data-generating mechanisms. We use a simulation framework that generates data on full GWAS for two traits under a realistic model for effect-size distribution. We further use recent data generated from GWAS of 38 biomarkers in the UK Biobank and performed down sampling to investigate trends in estimates of causal effects of these biomarkers on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D)

The development of accurate risk prediction models is hindered by the wide diversity of genetic architecture across different traits.

We developed a latent factor model to quantify trait heritability in excess of that captured by a common variant-based polygenic risk score.

Population-scale neuroimaging studies offer the promise of discovery and characterisation of subtle risk factors. Massive sample sizes increase the power for meaningful associations and those attributable to confounds. This motivates the need for causal modelling of observational data that goes beyond statements of association.

Top-performing approaches, which leverage identity-by-descent segments, often use only kinship coefficients. To quantify the potential for using segment numbers in relatedness inference, we leveraged information theory.

Genome-wide sequencing of human populations has revealed substantial variation among genes in the intensity of purifying selection acting on damaging genetic variants. Most genes under the strongest selective constraint are highly enriched for associations with Mendelian disorders. We show that genetic variants that damage these genes are associated with markedly reduced reproductive success.

Large-scale molecular profiling and genotyping provide a unique opportunity to compare the genetically predicted effects of therapeutic targets on the human metabolome. Genetically predicted effects were generally consistent among drug targets, which were intended to modify the same lipoprotein lipid trait.

In women, higher BioT was associated with obesity, upper-body fat distribution, and low HDL-cholesterol. Conversely, obesity and android fat distribution were associated with elevated serum BioT in men. Adipose tissue and metabolic dysfunction are associated with deranged sex hormone levels in both sexes.

Time-varying correlations (Functional Connectivity) in resting fMRI have been shown to be predictive of behavioural traits, and psychiatric and neurological conditions. Typically, methods that measure time varying Functional Connectivity (FC) do not separately model when changes occur in the mean activity levels and in the FC. We show that this can bias the estimation of time-varies FC to appear more stable over time than it actually is.

A total of 95,854 participants with complete data on plasma FA from the UK Biobank were enrolled between 2006 and 2010.

We report a correlation with red. hair for both strong-effect variants (rs1805007, rs1805008 and rs18 1905009) and weak-effect. variants. Our best model for predicting red versus other hair colours yields an unparalleled area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.96.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can provide useful information for personalized risk stratification and disease risk assessment. However, their construction depends on the availability of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) independent from the target sample. GWAS, especially in the field of cancer, often lack diversity and are predominated by European ancestry.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria and serum uric acid (SUA) are markers of kidney function that have been associated with cognitive ability. However, whether these associations are causal is unclear. We performed one-sample Mendelian randomization to estimate the effects of these kidney function markers on cognitive performance.

Chronic pain is a complex trait that is moderately heritable and genetically, as well as phenotypically, correlated with major depressive disorder (MDD) Use of the conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach has been successful in discovering novel associated variants in related phenotypes. Using a moderately conservative threshold, we identified a total of 11 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

Ancient DNA has identified changes in genetic ancestry over time, but it is not clear whether those changes in ancestry are associated with changes in height. We directly test whether changes over the past 38,000 y in European height predicted using DNA from 1,071 ancient individuals are consistent with changes observed in 1,159 skeletal remains. We show that the observed decrease in height between the Early Upper Paleolithic and the Mesolithic is qualitatively predicted by genetics.

Linear mixed-effects models (LMM) are a leading method in conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) They require residual maximum likelihood (REML) estimation of variance components, which is computationally demanding. We introduce two novel algorithms that exploit problem structure via the principle of Krylov subspace shift-invariance to speed computation.

Brain imaging data are increasingly made publicly accessible. volumetric imaging measures derived from population-based cohorts may serve as normative data for individual patient diagnostic assessment. Yet, these normative cohorts are usually not a perfect reflection of a patient's base population.

Growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) variants are a rare cause of thrombocytopenia. This case highlights how diagnoses of exclusion can be confounded by genetic variation.

This article presents the results of 2 studies that investigated mood instability in the Eysenck neuroticism scales. The mood instability factor was positively correlated with impulsivity. The remaining factors, largely reflecting trait anxiety, were also positively correlated. Taken together, the results suggest that mood instability and trait anxiety are separable components of Eysanckian neuroticism.

18 candidate genes for depression that have been studied 10 or more times were identified. No clear evidence was found for any candidate gene polymorphism associations with depression phenotypes or any polymorphism-by-environment moderator effects. The authors demonstrate that phenotypic measurement error is unlikely to account for these null findings.

Circulating levels of glycine have previously been associated with lower incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) It remains uncertain if glycine plays an aetiological role. We present a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for glycine in 80,003 participants.

Individuals with lower socio-economic status (SES) are at increased risk of physical and mental illnesses and tend to die at an earlier age. It is possible that phenotypic associations between SES and health arise partly due to a shared genetic etiology. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on social deprivation and on household income using 112,151 participants of UK Biobank. We find that common SNPs explain 21% of the variation in social deprived and 11% of household income.

Compared with participants who undertook no moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA, those who performed 150 to 300 min/wk of moderate- intensity PA (hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI,0.34-0.41]) were at lower HF risk.

Cancer-driving mutations might be enriched in genic subregions that are depleted of germline variation relative to somatic variation. We introduce a new metric, OncMTR (oncology missense tolerance ratio), which uses 125,748 exomes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) to identify these genicsubregions. We demonstrate that OncmTR can significantly predict driver mutations implicated in hematologic malignancies.

Publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics exhibit uneven quality, which can impact the validity of follow-up analyses. We show that additional information such as imputation INFO scores, allele frequencies, and per-variant sample sizes in GWAS summary statistics can be used to detect possible issues and correct for misspecifications.

Macrothrombocytopenia is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by enlarged and reduced numbers of circulating platelets. In most MTP, this phenotype arises because of altered regulation of platelet formation from megakaryocytes. We report the identification of DIAPH1, which encodes the Rho-effector diaphanous-related formin 1, as a candidate gene for MTP.

Analysis included 12&#x2009;364 adults aged 55-73 years from the UK Biobank cohort. Incident dementia was ascertained using hospital inpatient, death records and self-reported data. Diabetes, heart disease, stroke and depression at baseline were all associated with an increased risk of dementia.

Rare variants are collectively numerous and may underlie a considerable proportion of complex disease risk.

Daytime napping is a common, heritable behavior, but its genetic basis and causal relationship with cardiometabolic health remain unclear. We perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported daytime napping in the UK Biobank. Findings include missense variants in established drug targets for sleep disorders and genes suggesting an obesity-hypersomnolence pathway.

Despite considerable progress on pathogenicity scores prioritizing variants for Mendelian disease, little is known about the utility of these scores for common disease. Here, we assess the informativeness of Mendelians disease-derived pathogenicicity scores forCommon disease and improve upon existing scores. We then develop AnnotBoost, a machine learning framework to impute and denoise pathogenity scores.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) use the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to predict quantitative phenotypes or disease risk at an individual level. A major barrier to the use of PRS is that the majority of GWAS come from cohorts of European ancestry. The predictive power ofPRS constructed from these studies is substantially lower in non-European ancestry cohorts.

Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a frequent heart disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent genomic studies have identified a locus near the gene PALMD (palmdelphin) strongly associated with CAVS.

In this work, we investigate image registration in a variational framework and focus on regularization generality and solver efficiency. We first propose a model combining the state-of-the-art sum of absolute differences (SAD) and a new arbitrary order total variation regularization term. We then break down the resultant convex optimization into several point-wise, closed-form subproblems using a fast, over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers.

A higher dietary diversity score (DDS) and a lower energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII) may be associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and mortality. A total of 181,360 participants without all types of diabetes at baseline from the UK Biobank and 42,139 participants from the US NHANES were included. No evidence was observed of the interactive effects of DDS and E-D II on either all-cause mortality or the incidence and mortality of T2D.

The role of systemic inflammation in promoting cardiovascular diseases has attracted attention, but its correlation with various arrhythmias remains to be clarified. We aimed to comprehensively assess the association between various indicators of. systemic inflammation and atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF), ventricular arrhythmia (VA), and bradyarrhythmi in the UK Biobank cohort. VA showed the strongest association with systemic inflammation indicators, and it was followed sequentially by AF and Bradyarr hythmia.

Mendelian randomization using GWAS summary statistics has become a popular method to infer causal relationships across complex diseases. The widespread pleiotropy observed in GWAS has made the selection of valid instrumental variables problematic. We propose a ststistical framework, MRCI, to estimate reciprocal causation between two phenotypes simultaneously.

Metabolic illnesses (MET) are detrimental to brain integrity and are common comorbidities in patients with mental illnesses, including major depressive disorder (MDD) We quantified effects of MET on standard regional brain morphometric measures from 3D brain MRI as well as diffusion MRI in a large sample of UK BioBank participants. Subjects with MET showed a higher effect size for RVI-MET than for any of the individual brain measures.

Lifestyle factors are related to health and brain function and structure, but the brain systems involved are incompletely understood.

Middle-aged and older Europeans not diagnosed with dementia within two years of baseline were followed up and their data were analysed until 2021. The association between the nutrient quintiles measured by the web-based 24 h dietary and the risk of developing dementia was examined using a Cox proportional hazard model. A greater risk of dementia was associated with (a) no alcohol intake, (b) higher intake of total sugars and carbohydrates, (c) highest or lowest fat intake, and (d) highest protein intake.

 Proxy phenotypes based on parental diagnosis status have been used in previous studies to identify common variants associated with Alzheimer's disease. As of yet, proxy phenotypes have not been used to identify genes associated with the disease through rare variants. We show that a proxy Alzheimerâ€™s disease/dementia phenotype can capture known risk genes through rare variant aggregation.

The Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Study and the UK Biobank were evaluated. 2346 and 5314 incident AF events were recorded during the mean follow-up of 7.4 and 11.8 years. The risk of incident AF was increased by the combination of high-normal BP and IFG.

Sepsis is characterised by dysregulated, life-threatening immune responses. Sepsis is thought to be driven by cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) Genetic variants in IL6R known to down-regulate IL-6 signalling are associated with improved Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. We hypothesised that blockade of IL4R could also improve outcomes in sepsis. We performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and nearIL6R.

Study aimed to compare the biomarker profile of pre-frail and frail adults in the UK Biobank cohort by sex. Lower concentrations of apoA1, total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, albumin, eGFRcys, vitamin D, total bilirubin, apoB, and testosterone were identified. However, some of the associations differed by sex, such as rheumatoid factor and urate.

Penalized quasi-likelihood estimation allows to scale regularized mixed models on high-dimensional binary trait GWAS. We show through simulations that when the dimensionality of the relatedness matrix is high, penalized LMM and logistic regression with PC adjustment fail to select important predictors, and have inferior prediction accuracy.

Phenotypic associations have been reported between blood cell traits (BCTs) and a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders (NPDs) It remains unclear whether these associations have a genetic basis and, if so, to what extent genetic correlations reflect causality. We report genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses between 11 NPDs and 29 BCTs.

Survival rates from colorectal cancer (CRC) are drastically higher if the disease is detected and treated earlier. Current screening guidelines involve stool-based tests and colonoscopies, whose acceptability and uptake remains low. Routinely collected blood-based biomarkers may offer a low-cost alternative or aid for detecting CRC.

Estimation of heritability is crucial for quantifying and understanding complex trait genetic architecture.

Cancer continues to be a major source of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. Traditional methods of detection and diagnosis such as biopsy and imaging, tend to be expensive and have risks of complications. As data becomes more abundant and machine learning continues advancing, it is natural to ask how they can help solve some of these problems.

Viral exposures significantly associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease. Largest effect association was between viral encephalitis exposure and Alzheimer's disease.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) do not generalize across groups differing in ancestry or sample characteristics e.g., age. Quantifying performance of PRS across different groups of study participants using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from multiple ancestry groups and sample sizes may clarify which factors are limiting PRS transferability.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are increasingly used to estimate the personal risk of a trait based on genetics. Most genomic cohorts are of European populations, with a strong under-representation of non-European groups. Given that PRS poorly transport across racial groups, this has the potential to exacerbate health disparities.

Shorter stature and higher BMI were observationally associated with several measures of lower socioeconomic status in the study.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified hundreds of common genetic variants associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Identifying deviations from additivity may provide new biological insights and explain some of the missing heritability for these diseases.

COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. UK Biobank cohort recruited 502 649 adults aged 40-69 years. Of 353 occupations reported by 228 614 current working participants, several showed significantly increased COPD risk.

Neuroticism is a personality trait of fundamental importance for psychological well-being and public health. It is strongly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and several other psychiatric conditions. Although neuroticism is heritable, attempts to identify the alleles involved in previous studies have been limited by relatively small sample sizes.

People with higher levels of neuroticism have an increased risk of several types of mental disorder. Higher neuroticism has also been associated, less consistently, with an increase in risk of various physical health outcomes. We hypothesised that these associations may, in part, be due to shared genetic influences.

Genomic analyses have suggested that the LPA gene and its associated plasma biomarker, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a), represent a causal risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) This study aimed to establish the full phenotypic impact of LPAGene variation and to estimate a dose-response curve. One SD genetically lowered Lp(a), we found, was associated with a 29% lower risk of CHD.

Manual identification of signal and noise after ICA decomposition is required for efficient data denoising. We present a practical "how-to" guide to help determine whether single-subject fMRI independent components (ICs) characterise structured noise.

As genetic association studies increase in size to 100 000s of individuals, subtle biases may influence conclusions. One possible bias is 'index event bias' (IEB) that appears due to the stratification by, or enrichment for, disease status. We aimed to test the extent to which IEB influences some known trait associations.

Previous studies have suggested that modern obesogenic environments accentuate the genetic risk of obesity. However, these studies have proven controversial as to which, if any, measures of the environment accentuate genetic susceptibility to high body mass index (BMI) We used up to 120 000 adults from the UK Biobank study to test the hypothesis.

The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing faster among women than among men. We analyzed 149,075 women and 100,252 men taking part in the UK Biobank. The association of airflow obstruction with smoking characteristics was assessed by sex.

Lung cancer risk prediction models have been developed, but none to date have assessed the predictive ability of lung function in a population-based cohort. We sought to develop and internally validate a model incorporating lung function using data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study.

Physical activity has not been objectively measured in prospective cohorts with sufficiently large numbers to reliably detect associations with multiple health outcomes. Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the UK Biobank study.

 Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per allele. These variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders.

In observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain. We tested the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominalÂ adiposity, with typeÂ 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes.

Self-reported tiredness and low energy are associated with poorer physical and mental health. Twin studies have indicated that this has a heritability between 6 and 50%. In the UK Biobank sample (N=108 976), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS)

The health impairments derived from both alcoholism and obesity are well known. However, reports that relate increased alcohol use with increased measures of obesity have been mixed in their findings. Here, using a large sample of adults from the UK, we report both observed and genetic correlations between BMI (kg/m2) and two measures of alcohol use.

UK Biobank study is an ongoing prospective cohort of >0.5 million UK adults aged 40-69 y. Baseline data collection included measurements of GS and adiposity indicators, including body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2 ). Age- and sex-specific GS quintiles were used. Obesity class II was associated with a greater all-cause mortality risk.

Cross-sectional data from 119,859 white European adults, aged 37-73 y, participating in the UK Biobank. Interactions of GPRS-obesity and sleep characteristics (sleep duration, chronotype, day napping, and shift work) with effects on BMI and WC were investigated.

Mendelian randomization can test for and estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Most IV methods assume that the function relating the exposure to the expected value of the outcome is linear. We present two novel IV methods for investigating the shape of the exposure-outcome relationship.

UK Biobank is the world's largest repository for phenotypic and genotypic information for individuals of European ancestry. We identified 3290 VTE cases and 116 868 controls through billing code-based phenotyping. We performed a phenome-wide association study for a genetic risk score of 10 VTE-associated variants. In a Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically elevated body mass index was associated with 57% higher risk of VTE.

A common missense variant in the gene encoding a component of the sulfonylurea receptor ( ABCC8  p.A1369S) promotes closure of the target channel of sulfonyLurea therapy. The variant was associated with increased BMI but lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI.

UK Biobank participants were recruited and baseline measures were taken between 2007 and 2010. Self-report questionnaires were used to measure lifestyle behaviours. Six groups were defined based on BMI; 'Underweight', 'Normal weight', 'Overweight' and 'Obese'

Residential greenness was independently and consistently associated with lower adiposity. Residing in greener areas was associated with healthy weight outcomes possibly through a physical activity-related mechanism. Green allocation and design may act as upstream-level public health interventions.

Leisure screen time, including TV viewing, is associated with increased mortality risk. We estimated the all-cause mortality risk reductions associated with substituting leisure screen time with different discretionary physical activity types. Reallocations from screen time into specific activity subtypes suggested different reductions in mortality hazard.

In this study, we tested for differences in subcortical grey matter volume between depressed individuals and controls in the subset of 8590 UK Biobank Imaging study participants who had undergone depression assessments. Significant reductions were found in depressed individuals versus controls in global white matter integrity.

We estimated genotype by environment interaction (G Ã— E) on later cognitive performance and educational attainment across four unique environments. We used a novel design and statistical approach that was facilitated by the availability of datasets with the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) There was significant G Ã— E for both fluid intelligence (p-value = 1.0E-03) and educational. attainment (p -value = 8.3E-05) in the group of individuals who were breastfed without maternal smoking.

Cognitive ability is a heritable trait with a polygenic architecture. Haplotype-based analyses are a complementary technique that take phased genotype data into account. None of the assessed haplotypes provided evidence of a statistically significant association with cognitive ability in the individual cohorts or the meta-analysis.

Hispanic/Latino Americans are a diverse and understudied population. Hypertension prevalence varies between ethnic groups, possibly due to differences in genetic, environmental, and cultural determinants. We investigated whether previously reported loci associated with BP in studies of European, African, and Asian ancestry generalize to Hispanics/Latinos.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic loci to be associated with BMI and risk of obesity. In this study, we examine gene-environment interactions in 362,496 unrelated participants with Caucasian ancestry from the UK Biobank resource. 15 lifestyle factors were observed to interact with GSBMI.

For most traits and diseases the prediction R-squared (R-sq.) achieved with genetic scores remains considerably lower than the trait heritability. Modern biobanks will soon deliver unprecedentedly large biomedical data sets. Will the advent of big data close the gap between the trait. heritability and the proportion of variance that can be explained by a genomic predictor? We addressed this question using Bayesian methods and a data analysis approach.

The Trail Making Test is a widely used test of executive function. It has been thought to be strongly associated with general cognitive function. We examined the genetic architecture of the TMT and its shared genetic aetiology with other tests of cognitive function in 23 821 participants from UK Biobank.

Inadequate sleep (&#8804;6 and &#8805;9h) is more prevalent in smokers than non-smokers. We investigated the extent to which sleep duration predicted smoking behaviors and quitting intention in a population sample. Worsening sleep duration (adequate to inadequate) predicted a more than three-fold higher odds in increased cigarettes per day.

A reference panel of 1,000 individuals is adequate for a GWAS cohort of up to 10,000. Smaller panels, such as those from the 1000 Genomes Project, should be avoided. The size of the reference panel needs to scale with the GWAS sample size.

Genome-wide association studies have recently identified >400 loci that harbor DNA sequence variants that influence blood pressure (BP) Earlier studies identified 56 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with BP from meta-analyses of exome chip genotype data. An additional 100 variants yielded suggestive evidence of association.

Nicotine dependence is a heritable trait with established associations with sequence variants in nicotine acetylcholine receptor genes and at other loci. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of nicotine dependence, totaling 38,602 smokers across 15 studies. We reconfirmed the well-known CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 genes and yielded a novel association in the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3B.

A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the NOS3 or GUCY1A3 genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure. Pharmacological stimulation of nitricoxide signaling may prove useful in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Active commuting (AC) was reported by 5.5% of participants, with the great majority using the car to commute. AC was associated with reduced sedentary time. Deprivation and distance from home to work were identified as correlates of AC behaviour. Rates of AC are very low in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Using genome-wide association meta-analysis of 606,059 parents' survival, we discover two regions associated with longevity (HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA) We also validate previous suggestions that APOE, CHRNA3/5, CDKN2A/B, SH2B3 and FOXO3A influence longevity. Giving up smoking, educational attainment, openness to new experience and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are most positively genetically correlated with lifespan.

Iiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with high mortality, uncertain cause, and few treatment options. Studies have identified a significant genetic risk associated with the development of IPF; however, mechanisms by which genetic risk factors promote IPF remain unclear. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility and provide mechanistic insight.

Previous physical activity (PA) research in schizophrenia has relied largely upon self-report measures. Obtaining accurate measurements, and determining what may influence PA levels in schizophrenia, is essential to understand physical inactivity in this population. This study examined differences in self-reported and objectively measured PA in people with schizophrenia and the general population.

Exome-wide genetic analysis on >300,000 individuals identifies associations with plasma lipid traits. Loci significantly associated with cholesterol and triglycerides are examined together.

This large-scale genome-wide association analysis of subjects with asthma, hay fever or eczema provides insights into the shared genetic basis of these allergic diseases. The findings suggest these diseases partly co-occur because they share many genetic risk variants that dysregulate the expression of immune-related genes.

 Methods for genetic risk prediction have been widely investigated in recent years. Most available training data involves European samples, and it is currently unclear how to accurately predict disease risk in other populations. Here, we introduce a multiethnic polygenic risk score that combines trainingData from European samples and training data from the target population.

Male pattern baldness (MPB) or androgenetic alopecia is one of the most common conditions affecting men. The known genes explain little of the heritability. We present the results of a genome-wide association study including more than 70,000 men, identifying 71 independently replicated loci.

Genome-wide association studies using genotype data have had limited success in the identification of variants associated with major depressive disorder. Haplotype data provide an alternative method for detecting associations between variants in weak linkage disequilibrium with genotyped variants and a given trait of interest. A genome-wide haplotype association study for MDD was undertaken.

13 250 (3.5%) of 379 511 white European individuals in UK Biobank had developed diabetes in the first six decades of life. 1286 more cases of diabetes were in the half of the population with high genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes.

Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism variation contributes substantially to AF risk. Risk for AF conferred by genomic variation is similar to that observed for several other cardiovascular diseases. Established AF loci only explain a moderate proportion of disease risk.

Ninety-seven genetic risk loci have been identified to date, but the identification of additional susceptibility loci might be important to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of CAD.

Study analysed UK Biobank data from 489 079 participants. Crude diabetes prevalence was higher in men across all four ethnicities. After standardizing for age, SES, BMI and lifestyle factors, a significant sex difference in diabetes prevalence persisted.

High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) Both heritable and lifestyle risk factors contribute to elevated BP levels. We aimed to investigate the extent to which lifestyle factors could offset the effect of an adverse BP genetic profile.

Genome-wide association studies have identified >250 loci for body mass index (BMI) Most GWAS loci represent clusters of common, noncoding variants from which pinpointing causal genes remains challenging. Here we combined data from 718,734 individuals to discover rare and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF)

To date, genetic variants in more than 60 loci have been identified as associated with BMD. We identified variants associated with TB-BMD at 80 loci, of which 36 have not been previously identified. Only variants in ESR1 and close proximity to RANKL showed a clear effect dependency on age.

Gliomas are the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor. Few risk factors have been linked to their development. Handedness has been associated with several pathologic neurological conditions such as schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy.

By reanalyzing publicly available type 2 diabetes (T2D) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for 70,127 subjects, we identify seven novel associated regions. Five of the regions are driven by common variants (LYPLAL1, NEUROG3, CAMKK2, ABO, and GIP genes), one by a low-frequency (EHMT2), and one driven by a rare variant in chromosome Xq23 (rs146662075)

Much of the evidence about the effects of education comes from observational studies. We exploit the raising of the minimum school leaving age in the UK in September 1972 as a natural experiment. We found consistent evidence that remaining in school causally reduced the risk of diabetes and mortality in all specifications.

UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort comprising 502,637 men and women aged 40-69 years. History of fracture was self-reported, and details of hospital admissions for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (ICD-10:I20-I25) were obtained through linkage to UK Hospital Episode Statistics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate relationships between prior fracture and hospital admission.

Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease. We identify two new AS loci, on chromosome 1p21 near PALMD (rs7543130) and on chromosome 2q22 in TEX41 (rs1830321) The results implicate both cardiac developmental abnormalities and atherosclerosis-like processes in the pathogenesis of AS.

Physical activity levels and sedentary behaviours are inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. Whether these relationships are consistent across anatomical subsites is uncertain. We investigated the associations between coloreCTal cancer and physical activity (metabolic equivalents (METs)-hours per week), and indicators of sedentary behaviour.

Medications that relax this sphincter could promote cancer. These medications were investigated in two independent datasets. None of the medications investigated were significantly associated with oesophageal cancer risk apart from &#946;2 agonists.

We used the UK Biobank resource to develop genetic predictors of height. We applied these in a Mendelian randomisation framework to estimate the causal relationship between height and cancer. We found that each genetically predicted 9 cm increase in height conferred an odds ratio of 1.10. For both risk and mortality, the effect was larger in females than in males.

Little is known about the combined associations of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and hand grip strength (GS) with mortality in general adult populations. In UK Biobank, a prospective cohort of > 0.5 million adults aged 40-69 years, CRF was measured through submaximal bike tests; GS was measured using a hand-dynamometer.

Heritability is a fundamental parameter in genetics. Traditional estimates based on family or twin studies can be biased due to shared environmental or non-additive genetic variance. We applied an IBD-based approach to estimate heritability in unrelated individuals using phenotypic simulation.

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Previous studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with IOP, but these loci only explain a fraction of IOP heritability. Here, we describe the largest genome-wide association study to date using participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank.

We used UK Biobank data to examine the associations of four dietary patterns with frailty. We also examined whether metabolic signatures (MSs) mediate these associations. Four dietary patterns were independently associated withFrailty (all P   e.g. fatty acids, lipoproteins, acetate and glycoprotein acetyls) The MSs based on these metabolites partially mediated the association of these patterns.

Individual risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is modified by perturbations to the mass, distribution and function of adipose tissue. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations, we explored the molecular, cellular and whole-body effects of T2D-associated alleles near KLF14.

Protein-truncating variants can have profound effects on gene function. Their relevance to medical phenotypes has not been systematically assessed. We find several genes with strong pleiotropic or non-additive effects.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of liver damage and has a strong genetic component. The rs4841132 G>A variant, modulating the expression of protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B ( PPP1R3B ), has been reported to reduce the risk of NAFLD but at the same time may favor liver disease by facilitating glycogen accumulation. We assessed the impact of the variant on development of histologic steatosis and fibrosis in 1,388 European individuals.

Multiple methods have been developed to estimate narrow-sense heritability, h2, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in unrelated individuals. We present the most thorough and realistic comparison of these methods to date. We show that SNP-heritability can be highly sensitive to assumptions about the frequencies, effect sizes and levels of linkage disequilibrium of underlying causal variants.

Risk-taking propensity is a trait of significant public health relevance but few specific genetic factors are known. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported risk- taking propensity among 436,236 white European UK Biobank study participants. We identify genome- wide associations at 26 loci (P)

The genetic and genomic basis of sex differences in blood pressure (BP) traits remain unstudied at scale. We conducted sex-stratified and combined-sex genome-wide association studies of BP traits using the UK Biobank resource. Among associated loci, 412 were female-specific and 142 were male-specific. These sex-specific loci were enriched for hormone-related transcription factors.

Genetic correlation is a key population parameter that describes the shared genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. It can be estimated by current state-of-art methods, i.e., linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) The massively reduced computing burden of LDSC compared to GREML makes it an attractive tool.

 limited knowledge exists regarding the long-term risk of mental disorders among individuals who have experienced pregnancy loss. In the UK Biobank, a total of 218,990 women without any mental disorder at baseline were enrolled between 2006 and 2010 and followed until October 2022. Incidence rates of common mental disorders were elevated among women with a history of stillbirth, miscarriage or pregnancy termination.

We assessed the causal relation of four glycemic traits and type 2 diabetes liability with 167 metabolites. Fasting glucose and 2-h glucose were not associated with any metabolite. Higher glycated hemoglobin was associated with higher free cholesterol in small low-density lipoprotein.

The problem of the genetics of related phenotypes is often addressed by analyzing adjusted-model traits. Here, we adopt a joint view of adiposity traits in ~322,154 subjects. We classify 159 signals associated with body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), or WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) at P.

Population studies have been limited to European ancestries. This may have overlooked possible key genes poorly captured by common European genetic variation. Here, we report 26 loci (all P)

Diabetes patients are at higher risk for mortality than the general population. Little is known about whether the excess mortality risk associated with diabetes could be mitigated or nullified via controlling for risk factors.

 summary statistics from genome-wide meta-analyses are available for hundreds of traits. Updating these to ever-increasing reference panels is very cumbersome. A much more efficient method is to directly impute the summary statistics, termed as summary statistics imputation. Its performance relative to genotype imputation and practical utility has not yet been fully investigated.

General cognitive function is a prominent and relatively stable human trait that is associated with many important life outcomes. We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N = 300,486; age 16-102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci.

Developal dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is the most common skeletal developmental disease. Its genetic architecture is poorly understood. We find the heritable component of DDH attributable to common genetic variants to be 55% and distributed equally across the autosomal and X-chromosomes.

A sex-specific competing risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model was derived in individuals with type 1 diabetes without prior CVD. Predictors included age at diabetes onset, smoking status, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin level and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Sarcopenia refers to age-related loss of muscle mass and function. It is related to impaired somatic and brain health, including cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. The relationships between sarcopenia, brain structure and cognition are poorly understood. We show that sarcopenic traits are associated with lower cognitive performance and various brain magnetic resonance imaging measures.

The effect of a healthy lifestyle on dementia associated with multimorbidity is not well understood. We utilized data from the UK Biobank cohort. A comprehensive healthy lifestyle score was generated.

Cholelithiasis is a common digestive disease that drives a myriad of adverse complications. The correlation between sarcopenia and various digestive disorders has been extensively researched. We aimed to investigate the association through prospective and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.

Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strongly suggest that most traits and diseases have a polygenic component. This observation has led to an interest in "polygenic longevity scores (PLS)" that quantify the "risk" or genetic predisposition of an individual towards health. We argue that PLS are made up of variants not only robustly associated with parental lifespan, but also contribute to the genetic architecture of disease susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality.

We have undertaken a systematic Mendelian randomization (MR) study using methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) to assess the relationship between genetic variation, DNA methylation and 139 complex traits. Using two-sample MR, we identified 1148 associations across 61 traits where genetic variants were associated with both proximal DNAmethylation and complex trait variation.

We observe associations with one missense and one splice-donor variant (OR = 1.50) in RPL3L, the first ribosomal gene implicated to our knowledge.

Heavy alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for hypertension. The mechanism by which alcohol consumption impact blood pressure (BP) regulation remains unknown. We conducted a large two-stage investigation incorporating joint testing of main genetic effects and single nucleotide variant (SNV)-alcohol consumption interactions.

Low haemoglobin and anaemia are associated with poor cognition. anaemia is known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism of this risk is unknown. Here, we first seek to confirm the association between cognition and anemia. We then estimate the direction of causation using Mendelian randomisation.

A previous study of 200,000 exome-sequenced UK Biobank participants had implicated four genes, LDLR, PCSK9, APOC3 and IFITM5. In addition, a further 43 protein-coding genes were significant.

The negative impacts of social isolation and loneliness on health are well documented. Little is known about their possible biological determinants. In up to 452,302 UK Biobank study participants, we perform genome-wide association study analyses for loneliness.

Coffee consumption was inversely associated with gout. The urate-increasing GCKR, ABCG2, MLXIPL, and CYP1A2 alleles were associated with reduced daily coffee consumption.

We identify putative functional coding variation associated with changes in the QRS interval duration. ADAMTS6 encodes a secreted metalloprotease of currently unknown function. In vitro validation analysis shows that QRS-associated variants lead to impaired ADamTS6 secretion.

The cT1 value is a novel MRI-based quantitative metric for assessing a composite of liver inflammation and fibrosis. It has been shown to distinguish between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL) and non- alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, these studies were conducted in patients at high risk for liver disease. This study establishes the normal reference range of cT 1 values for a large UK population.

Household income and neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure may be related to diet and body weight. Understanding the double burden of these factors is a matter of public health importance. In a cohort of 51,361 adults aged 38-72 years in Greater London, UK, we jointly classified participants based on household income.

 meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with ~16 million genetic variants in 62,892 T2D cases and 596,424 controls of European ancestry. We identify 139 common and 4 rare variants associated with T 2D, 42 of which (39 common and 3 rare variants) are independent of the known variants. 3 genes (CAMK1D, TP53INP1, and ATP5G1) with plausible regulatory mechanisms.

 genome-wide association study of 60,620 atrial fibrillation cases and 970,216 controls. We identified 142 independent risk variants at 111 loci and prioritized 151 functional candidate genes. Many of the identified risk variants fall near genes where more deleterious mutations have been reported to cause serious heart defects.

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to measure residential greenness. The tinnitus is defined based on self-reported. In the cross-sectional analysis including 106471 participants, higher greenness is associated with lower odds of tinnitis. A similar association is observed in the longitudinal analysis.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease of women. Decline in lung function is variable, making appropriate targeting of therapy difficult. We used unbiased serum proteomics to identify markers associated with outcome in LAM.

In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for thousands of phenotypes in large biobanks, most binary traits have substantially fewer cases than controls. Both of the widely used approaches, the linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic mixed model, perform poorly. Here we propose a scalable and accurate generalized mixed model association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation.

A key public health need is to identify individuals at high risk for a given disease. One important approach is to stratify individuals based on inherited DNA variation. We develop and validate genome-wide polygenic scores for five common diseases. The approach identifies 8.0% of the population at greater than threefold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer.

Vitamin D (25-OHD) levels are associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) Since vitamin D is modifiable, these observations have substantial clinical and public health implications. Here, we explore causality in a large Mendelian randomisation (MR) study using an improved genetic instrument.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is thought to be the origin of myeloid neoplasms (MN) Yet, our understanding of the mechanisms driving CH progression to MN and clinical risk prediction of MN remains limited. We identified 115 proteins associated with MN risk of which 30% were also associated with CH.

Signal linkage disequilibrium profile regression is a method for detecting genome-wide directional effects of signed functional annotations on disease risk. We validate the method via simulations and application to molecular quantitative trait loci in blood, recovering known transcriptional regulators. We apply the method to expression quantitative traits in 48 Genotype-Tissue Expression tissues, identifying 651 transcription factor-tissue associations.

We characterized the prevalence and phenotypic consequences of X chromosome aneuploidy in a population of 244,848 women over 40 years of age from UK Biobank.

Alcohol consumption was associated with all assessed outcomes in a J-shaped manner relative to current non-drinkers. No statistically significant elevated risks were found at higher levels of drinking. For secondary prevention of CVD, current drinkers may not need to stop drinking.

A 1 mph (i.e., 1.6 kph) increase in self-reported habitual walking pace corresponds to a 63% (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.25-0.55) reduction in coronary artery disease risk. We used a latent variable framework throughout to model walking pace as a continuous exposure, which provided more robust and interpretable causal effect estimates. Our findings suggest that interventions that seek to encourage individuals to walk more briskly should lead to protective effects.

We use large-scale data from the UK Biobank to identify genetic variant-smoking interaction effects and show their importance in risk assessment.

The antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis is one of the leading theories in the evolutionary origin of aging. It states that mutations contributing to aging could be positively selected for if they are advantageous early in life and promote earlier reproduction or more offspring. The UK Biobank contains the genotypes and various phenotypes of 500,000 participants, offering an opportunity to test this hypothesis in humans.

We used a genetic approach to evaluate the linear and nonlinear relationships between alcohol consumption and mortality from different underlying causes. In conventional analysis, the association was 'J-shaped' But MR analyses supported a positive linear association with premature mortality.

The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in an increased prevalence of social isolation and loneliness. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association between social isolation/loneliness and multiple cardiometabolic diseases. Compared with those with the least loneliness, those who with most loneliness had about 20% increased risk of CMD.

The semiparametric Cox proportional hazards model, together with the partial likelihood principle, has been widely used to study the effects of potentially time-dependent covariates on a possibly censored event time. We propose a computationally efficient method for fitting the Cox model to big data involving millions of study subjects.

We show that higher polygenic risk scores, indicating individual's hereditary risk, were linearly associated with increased risks.

Long-term exposures to PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and NO x were associated with increased BD risk. Associations were still observed and even stronger at pollutant concentrations lower than WHO air quality guideline. These findings could help inform policy makers regarding ambient air quality standards and BD management.

The association between serum calcium and COPD risk remains unclear. We included 386,844 participants with serum calcium measurements and without airway obstruction at the baseline from UK Biobank.

A genome-wide meta-analysis of 100 studies in up to 835,465 individuals reveals 493 independent genetic variants in 352 loci, including 68 genetic variants outside previously identified resting heart rate associated loci. We prioritize 670 genes and in silico annotations point to their enrichment in cardiomyocytes and provide insights in their ECG signature. We do not find evidence for a linear or non-linear genetic association between resting heart rates and all-cause mortality.

Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic low-grade inflammation. Although chronic inflammatory conditions and diabetes are associated with anaemia, less is known about associations of obesity and body shape, independent of each other, with erythrocyte and reticulocyte parameters.

Obesity contributes substantially to the global burden of disease and has a significant heritable component. We identified genes in which rare heterozygous loss-of-function increases adult BMI in women ( DIDO1, PTPRG,  and  SLC12A5 ) and in men ( SLTM ), with effect sizes up to &#8764;8 kg/m 2 . This is complemented by analyses implicating rare variants in OBSCN and MADD for recalled childhood adiposity.

The burden of depression and anxiety in the world is rising. Identification of individuals at increased risk of developing these conditions would help to target them for prevention and ultimately reduce the healthcare burden. If deployed in a digital solution, it would allow individuals to track their risk, as well as provide some pointers to how to decrease it.

Major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules are capable of presenting neoantigens resulting from somatic mutations on cell surfaces, potentially directing immune responses against cancer. This led to the hypothesis that cancer driver mutations may occur in gaps in MHC capacity. If this is correct, it has important implications for understanding oncogenesis.

Human same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) is heritable, confers no obvious direct reproductive or survival benefit and can divert mating effort from reproductive opportunities. This presents a Darwinian paradox: why has SSB been maintained despite apparent selection against it? We show that genetic effects associated with SSB may confer a mating advantage.

There is considerable interest in GIPR agonism to enhance the insulinotropic and extrapancreatic effects of GIP, thereby improving glycemic and weight control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the leading risk factor, after age, is possession of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (APOE4) Approximately 50% of AD patients carry one or two copies of APOE4 but the mechanisms by which it confers risk are still unknown.

Genetic ancestry (GA) is more strongly associated with creatinine levels among healthy individuals than self-identified ethnicity. Black ethnicity shows a positive effect on participant serum creat inine levels. African ancestry has the highest association. GA (9.06%) explains significantly more of the variation in creatinin levels than ethnicity.

New therapies may help to prevent osteoporotic fractures other than increasing bone mineral density (BMD) Because fracture risk has an important genetic component, we aim to identify loci increasing fracture risk that do not decrease BMD. We found that only three loci affecting fracture risk exhibited genetic effects not mediated by BMD: SOST, CPED1-WNT16, and RSPO3.

Incidence of all-cause mortality, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation were determined. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and electrocardiogram measures were assessed.

A total of 501 379 participants from UK biobank who completed the questionnaire on the frequency of adding salt to foods at baseline. During a median of 9.0 years of follow-up, 18 474 premature deaths were documented. The multivariable hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] of all-cause premature mortality were 1.00 (reference), 1.02 (0.99, 1.06), and 1.28 (1.20,1.35) (P-trend)

PM 2.5 and NO 2 were positively associated with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in minimally adjusted models, but not in fully adjusted models. No associations for PM 10 were found. In analyses with additional adjustment for pre-existing chronic disease, effect estimates were not substantially attenuated.

Wellbeing, an important component of mental health, is influenced by genetic and environmental factors.

Liver fibrosis in middle age was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia, independent of shared risk factors.

The complex relationship between life course traumas and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the underpinning pathways are poorly understood. Using data from 104,939 participants from the UK Biobank, we demonstrate that subgroups of childhood, adulthood, and lifetime traum as were associated with CVD. Formal mediation analyses suggested that phenotypic aging partially mediated the above associations.

Intracranial volume (ICV) is frequently used in volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Findings of associations between ICV and age have varied, potentially due to differences in ICV estimation methods. We found both positive and negative cross-sectional associations with age, depending on dataset and ICv estimation method. Longitudinal ICV reductions were found for all ICV estimating methods.

Current epidemiologic evidence indicates that smoking is associated with a lower endometrial cancer risk. However, it is unknown if this association is causal or confounded. We conducted complementary observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. In the observational analysis, lifetime amount of smoking and ever having smoked regularly were associated with lower risk.

Progressive eGFR-decline can lead to kidney failure, necessitating dialysis or transplantation.

Among them, a rare intergenic variant at novel locus was associated with lower systolic blood pressure.

Haplotypes can be estimated from unphased genotype data via statistical methods. We show that genotype error inflates the observed switch error rate and that the relative bias increases with sample size. We propose an alternate definition of phase error that counts two consecutive switch errors as a single error.

Keratoconus can be a debilitating corneal ectasia in which the cornea thins, bulges, and steepens into a conical shape. Early features include myopia and irregular astigmatism, which affect vision and can be treated with contact lenses, collagen cross-linking, or, in advanced cases, cornea transplant. However, obtaining very large keratoconuus data sets for a genome-wide association study is problematic.

Recent work has found increasing evidence of mitigated, incompletely penetrant phenotypes in heterozygous carriers of recessive Mendelian disease variants. We leveraged whole-exome imputation within the full UK Biobank cohort to extend such analyses to 3,475 rare variants. Testing these variants for association with 58 quantitative traits yielded 102 significant associations involving variants previously implicated in 34 different diseases.

PRKN mutations are the most common recessive cause of Parkinson's disease and are a promising target for gene and cell replacement therapies.

The study included 244,393 UK Biobank participants who were free of systemic disease other than hypertension at baseline.

Exercise boosts neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus. Increased levels of the selenium transport protein selenoprotein P (SEPP1) in the serum of exercised animals may contribute to the impact of exercise. Selenium supplementation in the diet had the same effect as exercise in reducing some cognitive impairments associated with aging.

Study included 118,153 UK Biobank participants with data on statin use and corneal-compensated IOP. After excluding participants with neurodegenerative diseases, 41,638 participants with macular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (mRNFL) were available for analysis. Statin use was weakly associated with thinner mRNFL.

 Associations of liver, metabolic, and inflammatory biomarkers in blood with body shape are unclear. waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) are dependent on overall body size, resulting in bias. Study confirms associations with waist and hip size, independent of BMI, for metabolic biomarkers but only with waist size for inflammatory biomarker.

Statins lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and are widely used for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

 PKP2 (PKP2 tv) variants cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) yet display varied penetrance and expressivity. We determined the prevalence of an ARVC phenotype and other cardiovascular traits based on clinical and procedural data. Atrial fibrillation was over-represented in the UKB cohort in those with PKP1 tv.

Method based on inverse probability weighting, extended natural effect model method and weight-based imputation strategies were used. Simulation experiments of three scenarios were carried out to compare the performance of different methods in estimating direct and indirect effects in different situations. The regression method is more suitable for continuous mediator, and the inverse probabilities weighting method is for binary mediator.

Low vitamin D status is associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) Although most existing linear Mendelian randomization (MR) studies reported a null effect of vitamin D on CVD risk, a non-linear effect cannot be excluded. Our aim was to apply the non- linear MR design to investigate the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration.

Despite moderate-to-high genetic correlations across all 11 disorders, we find little utility of a single dimension of genetic risk across psychiatric disorders.

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) aggregate the effects of genetic variants across the genome and are used to predict risk of complex diseases, such as obesity. Current PRSs only include common variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) &#8805;1%), whereas the contribution of rare variants to predict disease remains unknown. Here, we examine whether augmenting the standard common variant PRS with a rare variantPRS improves prediction of obesity. We used genome-wide genotyped and imputed data on 451,145 European-ancestry participants.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrhythmia associated with an elevated risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a recognized risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which itself increases AF risk. It remains unknown whether Lp(a), a known ASCVD risk factor, is a causal mediator of AF independent of ASCVD. We found that each 50 nmol/L (23 mg/dL) increase in Lp (a) was associated with increased risk of incident AF.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized nonatherosclerotic cause of acute myocardial infarction. To assess which genes contribute to the development of SCAD, whole-exome sequencing was performed among individuals with SCAD. Rare disruptive variants were found within 10 collagen genes.

We conducted an exome-wide association study to identify rare risk variants contributing to MDD. 120,033 participants with MDD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were included. 34,761 qualifying variants were imported into the SKAT R-package to perform single variants, gene-based burden and robust burden tests with minor allele frequency (MAF)

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is significantly more frequent in Hispanics than in non-Hispanic Whites. Ancestry may explain these differences across ethnic groups.

Monogenic familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. Some mutation-negative patients have a polygenic cause for elevated LDL-C due to a burden of common LDL- C-raising alleles. People of White British (WB) ancestry have a 12-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) score. This score has yet to be evaluated in people of South Asian (SA), and Black and Caribbean (BC) ethnicities.

Caffeine-neuropathology correlations and interactions with lifestyle and genetic factors impacting caffeine metabolism and response were also tested. Caffeine intake was inconsistently associated with clinical dementia; potentially explained by cohort differences in underlying dementia etiology. Lewy bodies may link caffeine to lower risk in some persons.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus impacts disadvantaged groups most. Lifestyle factors are also associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. We explored effect modification of socioeconomic-status (SES) on associations between lifestyle and outcomes.

An early age at onset of major depression (AAO-MD) has been associated with more severe illness, psychosis, and suicidality. This study sought to investigate the genetic components underlying AAO- MD. We found a small but significant SNP-heritability (~6%) for the AAO -MD phenotype.

Few studies have derived dietary patterns based on intake of discretionary foods and beverages and examined associations with genetic risk and obesity. Data from 11,735 adults from the UK Biobank cohort study were used. A dietary pattern high in high-SFA and low-fiber discretionary food and beverages was associated with higher risk of obesity.

Women's reproductive factors include their age at menarche and menopause, the age at which they start and stop having children and the number of children they have. Studies that have linked these factors with disease risk have largely investigated individual reproductive factors and have not considered the genetic correlation and total interplay that may occur between them. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between eight female reproductive factors.

We conclude that at least 22 genes mediate CTS risk and highlight the role of 19 CTS variants in the biology of the extracellular matrix. Anthropometric traits including height and BMI are genetically correlated with CTS.

Post-translational modifications diversify protein functions and dynamically coordinate their signalling networks. Their genetic regulation or influence on complex traits is not fully understood. We compare the genetic regulation of the same PTM of two proteins - glycosylation of transferrin and immunoglobulin G.

 Depression is linked to dementia but whether it is a risk factor or an early sign of a developing dementia remains unclear. Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognised in both depression and Alzheimer's Disease. We hypothesised that recurrent depression has adverse effects on performance in cognitive tests.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) assumes that diffusion measured at typical b-values (approximately 1000 s/mm 2 ) is Gaussian. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of DTI that measures non-Gaussian diffusion (kurtosis) to better capture microenvironmental processes by incorporating additional data at a higher b-value. Using diffusion data (b-values of 1000 and 2000 s/ mm 2 ) from 700 UK Biobank participants aged 46-80, we establish a pattern of lower k Kurtosis alongside higher diffusivity among older adults.

This study included 391,366 participants of European ancestry initially free from pre-existing hypertension in the UK Biobank. Exposure to ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM 2.5, PM 2. 5-10 , and PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO X), was estimated. The associations between air pollutants and the incidence of hypertension were investigated.

Study looked at 13,602 European individuals with asthma diagnosed before 18 years old and 136,008 matched unexposed individuals without such an experience. Childhood asthma was associated with shorter attained adult height, irrespective of age at asthma diagnosis. The magnitude of height deviation in relation to asthma declined thereafter and became null after age 6.

Machine-learning algorithms can provide accurate predictions of age based on brain characteristics. There is significant variation in model accuracy reported across studies. Across subsets with different age ranges, performance metrics improve with increasing sample size. Age-bias corrected metrics indicate high accuracy, even for poorly performing models.

Alcohol misuse is a major global public health issue. The disorder is characterized by aberrant neural networks interacting with environment and genetics. Dissecting the neural substrates and functional networks that relate to longitudinal changes in alcohol use is important to elucidate therapeutic approaches. This study analyzed range of alcohol misuse in a population-based normative sample of 24,784 participants.

We examined interactions between educational attainment and genetic susceptibility on dementia risk among adults over 60 years old. A total of 174,161 participants were free of dementia at baseline. Low education attainment was significantly associated with higher dementia risk in the APOE &#949;4 carriers.

Wellbeing is an important aspect of mental health that is moderately heritable. Specific wellbeing-related variants have been identified via GWAS meta-analysis of individual questionnaire items. A multi-item within-subject index score has potential to capture greater heritability.

Studies examining cerebral asymmetries typically divide the l-R Measure (e.g., Left-Right Volume) by the L + R Measure to obtain an Asymmetry Index (AI) We used 306 global and regional brain measures provided by the UK Biobank. Removing any of these predictors changed the significance of sex differences in 33% of regions.

Frailty is a multidimensional syndrome of decline that affects multiple systems. Although chronological age is the major risk factor, inter-individual variation in risk is not fully understood. Leucocyte telomere length (LTL), a proposed marker of biological age, has been associated with risk of many diseases. We sought to determine whether LTL is associated withrisk of frailty.

Child maltreatment is associated with asthma in adults. We examined whether lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) or lifetime generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) mediate an association. 81 105 British adults in the UK Biobank completed a mental health survey.

Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes. Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping.

Individual diseases and multimorbidity are stronger predictors of dementia in non-APOE4 carriers.

 Complex-trait genetics has advanced dramatically through methods to estimate the heritability tagged by SNPs. The models underlying many of these analyses are inadequate, and consequently many SNP-heritability results have been inaccurate.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) epitomize this type of setting. Although the GWAS marginal estimator is popular, it has been criticized for ignoring the correlation structure of genetic variants. We show that the performance of GWASmarginal estimator depends on the LD pattern.

Of 470,853 UKB participants, 4.0% had pneumonia and 0.2% had influenza during follow up. Increased consumption of coffee, tea, oily fish, and fruit at baseline were significantly and independently associated with a lower risk of future pneumonia events. After multivariable adjustment, the odds of pneumonia (p &#8804; 0.001 for all) were lower by 6-9% when consuming 1-3 cups of coffee/day.

Study looked at prevalence of phenotypes as a function of the polygenic score (PGS) across environments in the UK Biobank cohort study.

Metabolic syndrome is a group of heritable metabolic traits that are highly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) Classical interventions to T2DM include improving diet quality, increasing physical activity, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption. It is poorly understood how the phenotypes of diabetes-related metabolic traits change with respect to lifestyle modifications at the individual level.

Genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) can be estimated using prediction models derived from large multi-omic datasets. We applied PrediXcan to impute GReX in 51,520 ancestrally diverse Population Architecture. We identified 517 associations across 47 tissues in PAGE but not UKBB 50k. Our findings call for more diversity in reference datasets of tissue-specific gene expression.

Previous studies showed that diet and gut microbiota had a correlation with sleep.

Significant genetic correlations were discovered between insomnia/sleep duration and dietary habits.

Study looked at changes in body composition in 3088 free-living participants, part of the UK Biobank in-depth imaging study. All participants underwent neck-to-knee MRI scans at the first imaging visit and after approximately two years. No significant changes were observed in BMI, body weight, or waist circumference over the scanning interval.

Polygenic inheritance plays a pivotal role in driving multiple sclerosis susceptibility. We developed polygenic risk scores (PRS) of multiple sclerosis and assessed associations with both disease status and severity in cohorts of European descent. Individuals within the top 10% of PRS were at higher than 5-fold increased risk in UK Biobank and 15-fold higher risk in KPNC.

Risk scores from routine blood tests can be repurposed to estimate 10-year risk of cirrhosis morbidity in the community. Genetic risk factor information to these scores only modestly improved performance.

Study included data from 39 294 participants with hypertension in the UK Biobank study. During a median follow-up of 6.25 years (241 418 person-years), 1518 deaths (549 attributable to CVD) and 4933 CVD (fatal and nonfatal) incident events were registered. Compared with the lowest category of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, the relative risks (hazard ratios and 95% CIs) of all-cause mortality for increasing categories were 0.53 (0.46-0.61)

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) Statins reduce low-density lipoproteins and positively affect CVD outcomes. Statin type and dose have differential effects on glycaemia and risk of incident T2DM.

Heavy alcohol consumption has been associated with brain atrophy, neuronal loss, and poorer white matter fiber integrity. There is conflicting evidence on whether light-to-moderate alcohol consumption shows similar negative associations with brain structure. We examine the associations between alcohol intake and brain structure using multimodal imaging data from the UK Biobank.

Half a million adults were recruited into the UK Biobank prospective cohort study between March 2006 and October 2010. The main outcome measure was a composite primary outcome of 30-day major postoperative complications and 90-day all-cause mortality. Elevated pre-operative HbA 1c in people without diabetes may be associated with an increased risk of complications, but the association is likely confounded by end-organ comorbidity.

Genetic predisposition has been shown to contribute substantially to the age at which we die. Little is known about how lifespan is impacted by gene loss of function. Through whole-exome sequencing of 352,338 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry we assessed the relevance of protein-truncating variant (PTV) gene burden.

On 462 063 participants of European ancestry, we characterized the relationship of 38 disease-relevant biomarkers, asthma diagnosis, ambient pollution, traffic factors, and genetic background. 30 biomarkers were in association with at least one environmental factor. Asthma diagnosis was associated with four pollutants (NO, NO 2 , PM 2.5 , and PM 10 ). The largest effect size was observed in PM 2, where a 5 &#956;g/m 3  increment of exposure was linked to a 1.52 increase in asthma diagnosis.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a common tool for identifying causal risk factors underlying diseases. Here, we present a method, MR with automated instrument determination (MRAID), for effective MR analysis. MRAID borrows ideas from fine-mapping analysis to model an initial set of candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

A total of 409,110 participants from the UK Biobank study, recruited between 2006 and 2010, were included. Compared with meat-eaters, vegetarians and pescatarians had a lower risk of overall, colorectal, and prostate cancer. No associations between the types of diets and prostate, breast, or lung cancers were found.

Some evidence suggests that being vegetarian may be associated with a lower risk of cancer overall. However, for specific cancer sites, the evidence is limited. We assessed associations of vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets with risks of all cancer, colorectal cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, and prostate cancer.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac arrhythmia disorder associated with sudden death in young adults. With the exception of SCN5A, encoding the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5, susceptibility genes remain largely unknown.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are an increasingly available tool to refine risk prediction for cardiometabolic diseases. Favorable lifestyle behaviors might offset increased polygenic risk, but whether frequency of depressed mood stratifies PRS-associated risk is unknown. We calculated individual-level 3-million variant PRS for coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and atrial fibrillation in the UK Biobank.

Cardiac function quantification from MRI is still not a fully automatic process in the clinical practice. This is partly due to the shortage of training data covering all relevant cardiovascular disease phenotypes. We propose to synthetically generate short axis CINE MRI using a generative adversarial model.

The association between air pollution and dementia, and modification by apolipoprotein E genotype 4 (APOE-&#949;4) has yet to be fully investigated. UK Biobank enrolled >500,000 participants with ongoing follow-up.

Case-control status does not account for the fact that not all controls may have lived through their period of risk for the disorder of interest. The age-of-onset distribution may also depend on information such as sex and birth year. Here, we present LT-FH++, an extension of the liability threshold model conditioned on family history.

Pancreatic body PDFF was different between T2DM and nondiabetics matched by body mass index. The developed segmentation's performance was no different from manual annotations. Application on type 2 diabetes subjects showed potential for assessing pancreatic disease heterogeneity.

Study included 393,690 participants without CVD at baseline measurements between March 13, 2006, and October 1, 2010, from UK Biobank. During a median follow-up of 8.93 years, we observed 10,218 incident CVD events, including 6595 myocardial infarctions (MIs) and 3906 strokes. Among participants with a poor sleep pattern, unfavorable lifestyle (per score increase) was associated with 25% (95% CI, 13% to 39%) increased risks for CVD and MI.

Genetic variants within the APOE locus may modulate Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk independently or in conjunction with APOE*2/3/4 genotypes. Identifying variants and mechanisms would importantly advance our understanding of APOE pathophysiology and provide critical guidance for AD therapies aimed at APOE.

We used Mendelian randomisation with polygenic risk scores (PRS) to investigate whether associations between maternal pre-/early pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and offspringÂ adiposityÂ from birth to adolescence are causal. We found a positive association between maternal BMI and BW, supporting a moderate causal effect.

Clinical presentation of congenital heart disease is heterogeneous, making identification of the disease-causing genes and their genetic pathways and mechanisms of action challenging. Here we identify 705 lines with cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial hypertrophy and/or ventricular dilation. Among these 705 genes, 486 have not been previously associated with cardiac dysfunction in humans.

We aimed to investigate if the genetic risk of PCOS is associated with BMD and fracturerisk in women and men in the UK Biobank dataset.

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Most previous GWAS4-23 have been conducted in European ancestry populations. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements.

Excess liver fat, called hepatic steatosis, is a leading risk factor for end-stage liver disease and cardiometabolic diseases. It often remains undiagnosed in clinical practice because of the need for direct imaging assessments. We developed an abdominal MRI-based machine-learning algorithm to accurately estimate liver fat from 4,511 middle-aged UK Biobank participants.

Past-oriented rumination and future-oriented worry are two aspects of perseverative negative thinking related to the neuroticism endophenotype and associated with depression and anxiety. Genetic associations for worry did not implicate specific biological processes, while past- oriented rumination had a more specific genetic background. Biological pathways leading to rumination appeared to differ according to folate intake.

Schizophrenia is associated with a marked reduction in reproductive success. Yet alleles that are common contribute substantially to the liability of the disorder. Authors sought to test this hypothesis, isolating the effects of risk alleles on fecundity from the effects that are contingent on expressing schizophrenia.

Cytokines and growth factors have been implicated in the initiation and propagation of vascular disease. Our objective was to explore whether genetically determined circulating levels of these factors are associated with stroke and its etiologic subtypes. Genetic instruments were obtained from a genome-wide association study of 8293 healthy adults.

Studies have shown strong positive associations between serum urate (SU) levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk. We evaluate whether genetic data are consistent with a causal impact of SU level on the risk of CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

Iron is essential for life but contributes to oxidative damage. In Northern-European ancestry populations, HFE gene C282Y mutations are relatively common. Iron excess can be prevented or treated but diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Data on sarcopenia, pain, and frailty are scarce.

HFE p.C282Y genetic variant responsible for most hereditary haemochromatosis type 1. Study compared prevalent and incident morbidity and mortality between those with the variant and those with no.

We identified a locus at genome-wide significance in an intron of PLEKHG1 (rs275350, &#946; [SE] = 0.071 [0.013];  p  = 1.6 Ã— 10 -8 ), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is involved in reorientation of cells. The same single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with all ischemic stroke.

Diverticular disease is a common complex disorder characterised by mucosal outpouchings of the colonic wall that manifests through complications such as diverticulitis, perforation and bleeding. We report the to date largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic risk factors for diverticular disease.

Research demonstrates a negative relationship between alcohol use and affect. But the value of deprecation is unknown and thus cannot be included in estimates of the cost of alcohol to society. This paper aims to examine this relationship and develop econometric techniques to value the loss in affect attributable to alcohol consumption.

We used Mendelian randomization to assess the role of thyroid dysfunction for cardiovascular disease (CVD) Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with thyroid function were identified from a genome-wide association meta-analysis. Genetically predicted thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and hyperthyroidism were significantly associated with atrial fibrillation but no other CVDs.

 MAGO is a magnitude-based reconstruction that embodies multipeak liver fat spectral modeling and multipoint optimization. It is compatible with asymmetric echo acquisitions. MAGO was shown to be more robust to artefacts compared to LMS IDEAL.

Study was designed to test the hypothesis that refractive errors such as myopia and hyperopia cause an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. The risk AMD was caused by a 1-diopter (D) change in refractive error.

Major depression (MD), alcohol dependence (AD), and alcohol consumption (AC) have established clinical associations. We leveraged genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and UK Biobank to test for the presence of shared genetic mechanisms. Positive genetic correlation was observed between MD and AD.

Lower-complexity cardiac malformations constitute the majority of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) Long-term risks of adverse cardiovascular events and relationship with conventional risk factors in this population are poorly understood. We aimed to quantify the risk of adverse. cardiovascular events associated with lower- complexity ACHD that is unmeasured by conventional. risk factors.

Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with many genetic variants of individually small effect contributing to phenotypic variation. Lower cortical thickness (CT), surface area, and cortical volume have been demonstrated in people with schizophrenia. A range of obstetric complications (e.g., lower birth weight) are consistently associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia. We investigated whether a high polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PGRS-SCZ) is associated with CT, surface area and corticalVolume.

Study uses data from 77 743 UK Biobank participants. Found significant difference in experienced temperature of ~1.8&#176;C between the periods of coldest and hottest external temperature. People of Chinese ethnic background experienced 0.65&# 176;C lower temperatures than other groups.

 Syncope is a common condition associated with frequent hospitalization or visits to the emergency department. Family aggregation and twin studies have shown that syncope has a heritable component. We investigated whether common genetic variants predispose to syncope and collapse. We report on a genome-wide significant locus located on chromosome 2q32.1.

There is mounting evidence that our environment and lifestyle has an impact on epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA methylation. It has been suggested that these molecular processes may mediate the effect of risk factors on disease susceptibility. Using genetic variants as surrogate variables, we have used two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) to investigate the potential implications of putative changes to DNA methylated levels.

There may be differences in hematological parameters between meat-eaters and vegetarians. Blood count was carried out in all UK Biobank participants at recruitment. People with low or no red meat intake generally had lower hemoglobin concentrations.

Novel, effective, and safe drugs are warranted for treatment of ischemic stroke. Circulating protein biomarkers with causal genetic evidence represent promising drug targets. No systematic screen of the proteome has been performed.

Study aimed to explore potential side effects and repurposing potential of antihypertensive drugs. Mendelian randomization estimates for drug effects on coronary heart disease and stroke risk were compared with randomized, controlled trial results. Suitable genetic proxies for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were identified.

Mendelian randomisation allows for the testing of causal effects in situations where clinical trials are challenging to do. We used genome-wide data available from the UK Biobank to construct a genetic risk score of 76 variants related to BMI. After Bonferroni correction, PheWAS identified that BMI geneticrisk score was associated with hospital-diagnosed obesity and 58 other outcomes.

Genetic variants at the LPA locus are associated with both calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) Whether these variants are linked with CAVS in patients with CAD vs those without CAD is unknown. This study included patients undergoing cardiac surgery from the Genome-Wide Association Study on Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis in Quebec. Data were collected from January 1993 to September 2018.

A data-driven accelerometer metric, the acceleration above which a person's most active minutes are accumulated, can quantify the prevalence of meeting current physical activity guidelines for global surveillance. Unlike cut-point methods, the metric is population-independent (e.g. age) and potentially comparable across datasets.
