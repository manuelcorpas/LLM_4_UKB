ChatGPT o1,https://chatgpt.com/,"As of this writing, **UK Biobank does not publish a real-time “league table”** of institutions ranked by the number of applications. While it’s clear that certain universities and research institutes have generated a large volume of UK Biobank projects—most notably within the UK, but also from the US, Europe, and Asia—official, consistently updated data identifying the exact “top 10” is not publicly posted in a single source.

However, based on partial statistics in **UK Biobank’s annual reports**, conference presentations, and anecdotal information from the research community, the institutions most frequently appearing among major users of UK Biobank data are typically:

1. **University of Oxford**  
2. **University of Cambridge**  
3. **University College London (UCL)**  
4. **King’s College London (KCL)**  
5. **Imperial College London**  
6. **University of Manchester**  
7. **University of Edinburgh**  
8. **University of Glasgow**  
9. **University of Bristol**  
10. **Wellcome Sanger Institute**  

Occasionally, large-scale genomics institutes in the US (such as the **Broad Institute**) and certain Chinese universities or research centers also appear prominently.

### Important Caveats

1. **Lack of a Formal, Publicly Available Ranking**  
   - UK Biobank’s website provides a searchable database of *publications* (and details of the underlying Application IDs), which can help approximate how active certain institutions are. However, this does *not* provide an at-a-glance list of which institution holds how many *total* approved applications.

2. **Moving Target**  
   - Applications are continuously submitted and approved, so the ranking changes as new proposals come in.  
   - Mergers or collaborations sometimes lead to multiple institutions being listed on a single application, further complicating any strict “ranking by institution.”

3. **Large Collaborative Projects**  
   - Some of the biggest, most-cited UKB studies involve **consortia** with multiple collaborating institutions—so counting “applications” per institution only partially reflects actual usage.

### How You Can Check or Approximate Rankings

- **Search the UK Biobank Publications page**:  
  - Go to “[UK Biobank Publications](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/publications)” and filter by institution or author affiliation. Although it reflects *papers*, not *applications*, institutions with the highest publication counts often have among the highest application counts.

- **Review Annual Reports**:  
  - Periodically, UK Biobank includes metrics in its [annual and interim reports](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/about-us/governance/annual-reports) showing the geographic spread and approximate number of registered researchers. While not a direct count of applications per institution, it gives a sense of relative usage.
