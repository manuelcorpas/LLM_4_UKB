ChatGPT o1,https://chatgpt.com/,"No **official, up-to-date “top 20” list** of the most prolific UK Biobank authors is publicly maintained. Various citation databases (e.g., **PubMed**, **Scopus**, **Web of Science**, **Google Scholar**) allow you to *approximate* such a ranking by searching for papers that reference UK Biobank and then sorting by author contributions, but each database will yield slightly different results depending on how it captures author names, addresses, and the scope of “UK Biobank” keywords.

Nonetheless, certain researchers frequently appear across UK Biobank publications. Below are examples of authors who often show up (in no particular order) as lead, senior, or contributing authors on a *large volume* of papers. This list is based on publicly available bibliometric clues (e.g., from PubMed or Google Scholar) and **is not an official ranking**:

1. **Rory Collins** – Principal Investigator of UK Biobank, University of Oxford  
2. **Naomi Allen** – Chief Scientist of UK Biobank, University of Oxford  
3. **Cathie Sudlow** – Former Chief Scientist of UK Biobank, University of Edinburgh  
4. **Paul Elliott** – Imperial College London, involved in large-scale epidemiological studies using UKB data  
5. **John Danesh** – University of Cambridge, notable for cardiovascular and epidemiological studies

19. **Panos Deloukas** – Queen Mary University of London, large-scale genomic studies  
20. **Cathryn Lewis** – King’s College London, genetics of psychiatric and complex traits  

> **Important Caveats**  
> - **Name Ambiguities**: Some names above (e.g., Paul Elliott, Paul T. Elliott) may overlap with other researchers unless carefully disambiguated by affiliation and middle initials.  
> - **Collaborative Projects**: UK Biobank is renowned for huge consortia-based publications, meaning dozens or even hundreds of authors can appear on a single paper. Often the *consortium name* rather than individuals is most prominent in citations.  
> - **Dynamic Landscape**: Author productivity changes over time; new investigators or large collaborative groups may emerge as top publishers of UKB-based research.  
> - **Database Differences**: Each bibliometric database (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) uses different indexing rules. This can significantly affect the *ranking* and *citation counts*.  

### How to Generate Your Own Ranking
1. **Use Citation Databases**: Conduct an “Advanced Search” in PubMed or Scopus using a query like `""UK Biobank"" [Title/Abstract]` (in PubMed) or equivalent in Scopus/Web of Science. Export results, then parse author lists across papers.  
2. **Filter & Count**: Identify unique authors (accounting for variations in spelling, initials, or institutional affiliations). Tally the total number of publications.  
3. **Sort by Publication Count**: You can refine further by weighting authorships (e.g., first or last author vs. middle author), or you can keep a simple count of the total appearances in any author position.

Because there is **no central, publicly available “top 20 authors” list** curated by UK Biobank, any list you see (including the example above) is necessarily an approximation. If you need *precise*, *current*, and *verified* data, you may have to **contact UK Biobank** directly or generate your own bibliometric analysis using advanced search and text-mining techniques."
ChatGPT o1 pro,https://chatgpt.com/?model=o1-pro,"Identifying the *“top 20 most prolific authors”* publishing on the UK Biobank is challenging because:

1. **No Official “Leaderboard”**: The UK Biobank does not maintain or publish a live ranking of authors by publication count.  
2. **Dynamic Literature**: New papers appear every week, and citation databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) show different author tallies depending on indexing methods (e.g., spelling of names, affiliation changes).  
3. **Consortia & Large Teams**: Many high-impact publications involve large collaborative groups (e.g., GWAS consortia), making it harder to attribute a single “lead” author role.

Despite these limitations, some individuals appear repeatedly in *key Biobank resource papers* and in *high-volume genetic or epidemiological studies*. Below is a **representative** (but **not official or exhaustive**) roster of authors who have frequently published using UK Biobank data. They are listed **alphabetically**—not by rank or publication count—and drawn from publicly available sources such as PubMed, institutional profiles, and major consortia acknowledgments.

### Important Notes

1. **Not a Formal Ranking**  
   - This list is assembled from visibility in the literature, presence on foundational Biobank publications, and repeated authorship on widely cited genetic or epidemiological papers. *Actual citation counts* or *publication volumes* can shift with each new study.

2. **Group Authorship and Consortia**  
   - Many large-scale GWAS or imaging consortia list dozens or even hundreds of co-authors, often with rotating first/last authors. Some authors appear across multiple consortia or labs, inflating their publication numbers.

3. **Changing Affiliations**  
   - Over time, leading investigators may move institutions; you will often see them listed under multiple affiliations in different Biobank papers.

4. **How to Verify**  
   - If you need a *real-time, data-driven “top 20”* list, you could conduct a bibliometric search (e.g., in PubMed or Scopus) with queries like `(“UK Biobank”) AND (Author[au])` and then filter for total publications. You would need to:  
     - Consolidate *variant spellings* of names.  
     - Exclude consortia that do not list authors individually.  
     - Account for changes in institutional affiliations or name changes.

### Summary

While there is no single published scoreboard of the most prolific authors using UK Biobank, a *recurring set* of researchers stands out due to their deep involvement in developing the resource (e.g., **Rory Collins**, **Naomi Allen**, **Cathie Sudlow**) or leading **high-impact, large-scale genetic or epidemiological studies** (e.g., **John Danesh**, **Paul Elliott**, **Tim Frayling**, **George Davey Smith**). They—and the major UK, US, and international groups they represent—collectively shape much of the high-profile output from this globally influential biomedical cohort."
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (explanatory style),https://claude.ai/chat,"I apologize, but I cannot determine the top 20 most prolific authors publishing on the UK Biobank from the provided documents alone. While these papers include various authors and collaborators, they don't provide comprehensive publication statistics or author rankings.

From the provided papers, I can only see some recurring authors and research groups, but this is not sufficient to make claims about who publishes most frequently using UK Biobank data. To accurately identify the most prolific authors, you would need:

1. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis
2. Publication databases covering all UK Biobank papers
3. Citation counts and publication metrics
4. Author contribution data across multiple years

Making claims about the most prolific authors without this data would be speculative and potentially misleading. For accurate information about publication patterns and author productivity, one would need to conduct a systematic analysis of all UK Biobank-related publications."

However, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **PubMed**: Search for ""UK Biobank"" and use the filters to sort by author or number of publications.
2. **Google Scholar**: Search for ""UK Biobank"" and analyze the authors with the most citations or publications.
3. **Web of Science or Scopus**: These databases allow you to search for authors by topic and rank them by the number of publications.
4. **UK Biobank Publications**: The UK Biobank website itself often lists key publications and may highlight prolific contributors.

To identify the most prolific authors:
- Use advanced search tools to filter by author and count publications.
- Look for authors who frequently appear in high-impact journals or collaborative studies.
- Consider authors affiliated with major institutions like the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, or other leading research centers.
