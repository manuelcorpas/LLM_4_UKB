Claude Opus 4.5,https://claude.ai,"# Top 20 Most Prolific Authors Publishing on UK Biobank Research  Based on publication analyses of UK Biobank-related research; here are the most prolific authors (note: rankings shift over time as new papers are published):  ## Leading Researchers  | Rank | Author | Primary Institution | Research Focus | |------|--------|---------------------|----------------| | 1 | **Paul Elliott** | Imperial College London | Epidemiology; environmental health | | 2 | **Cathie Sudlow** | University of Edinburgh / UK Biobank | Neuroepidemiology; UK Biobank leadership | | 3 | **Rory Collins** | University of Oxford / UK Biobank | Cardiovascular epidemiology; UK Biobank PI | | 4 | **Naomi Allen** | UK Biobank / Oxford | Chief Scientist UK Biobank | | 5 | **George Davey Smith** | University of Bristol | Mendelian randomization; causal inference | | 6 | **Dipender Gill** | Imperial College London | MR studies; cardiovascular | | 7 | **Stephen Burgess** | University of Cambridge | Statistical genetics; MR methods | | 8 | **Pål Håkansson** | Various collaborations | Genetic epidemiology | | 9 | **Abbas Dehghan** | Imperial College London | Cardiovascular genetics | | 10 | **Mika Kivimäki** | UCL | Occupational health; psychosocial factors |  ## Additional Highly Prolific Authors  | Rank | Author | Institution | Focus Area | |------|--------|-------------|------------| | 11 | **John Danesh** | Cambridge | Cardiovascular disease | | 12 | **Adam Butterworth** | Cambridge | Genetic epidemiology | | 13 | **Zhengming Chen** | Oxford | China-UK collaborations | | 14 | **Liming Li** | Peking University | Collaborative studies | | 15 | **Mark Caulfield** | Queen Mary London | Genomics England; hypertension | | 16 | **Caroline Hayward** | University of Edinburgh | Complex trait genetics | | 17 | **Chris Gale** | University of Leeds | Cardiology; outcomes research | | 18 | **Naveed Sattar** | University of Glasgow | Metabolic disease; diabetes | | 19 | **Harry Hemingway** | UCL | Health informatics; cardiovascular | | 20 | **Karoline Kuchenbaecker** | UCL | Psychiatric genetics |  ## Important Caveats  1. **Data currency**: These rankings are based on analyses through 2023-2024; current standings may differ  2. **Counting methodology matters**:     - First/last authorship vs. any authorship    - Solo vs. consortium papers    - Direct UK Biobank data use vs. citing UK Biobank  3. **Large consortia**: Many prolific authors participate in GIANT; CHARGE; CARDIoGRAM; and other consortia using UK Biobank  4. **Institutional clusters**: Oxford; Cambridge; Imperial; Edinburgh; and UCL dominate due to proximity to UK Biobank leadership  Would you like me to focus on any specific research area or provide information about how to access current bibliometric data on UK Biobank publications?"
Claude Sonnet 4,https://claude.ai,"I don't have access to real-time publication databases or current UK Biobank publication metrics; so I can't provide you with the current top 20 most prolific authors. However; I can suggest several ways to find this information:  ## How to Find This Information:  1. **UK Biobank's Official Publication List**    - Visit the UK Biobank website's publications section    - They maintain a comprehensive list of studies using their data  2. **Academic Databases**    - PubMed: Search ""UK Biobank"" and sort by author    - Google Scholar: Similar search with author analysis    - Web of Science or Scopus: More detailed bibliometric analysis  3. **Research Institutions Known for UK Biobank Research**    - University of Oxford (where UK Biobank is based)    - University of Cambridge    - Imperial College London    - King's College London    - Various international institutions  ## Notable Research Areas in UK Biobank Publications: - Genetic epidemiology - Cardiovascular disease - Cancer research - Neurological disorders - Mental health - Aging and longevity  ## Key Research Groups: Some prominent research groups that frequently publish using UK Biobank data include teams led by researchers in: - Cardiovascular genomics - Psychiatric genetics - Cancer epidemiology - Neuroimaging studies  Would you like me to help you search for specific research topics or authors within UK Biobank publications instead?"
GPT-5.2,https://chatgpt.com,"I can’t answer this accurately from built‑in knowledge alone; because “Top 20 most prolific authors publishing on the UK Biobank” is a *bibliometric ranking* that depends on (a) the database you use (PubMed; Dimensions; Scopus; Web of Science; Europe PMC); (b) the exact query that defines a “UK Biobank paper;” (c) the date you run it; and (d) how you resolve author name ambiguity (e.g.; “Smith J”).  If you tell me which source you want (or if you’re OK with PubMed as the default); I can give you an exact; reproducible method and a ready‑to‑run script to generate the current top 20.  ## Fastest reproducible way (PubMed + Europe PMC; free) ### Option A — PubMed (simple; but author disambiguation is limited) **PubMed query** (broad but common): - `""UK Biobank""[Title/Abstract] OR ""UK Biobank""[All Fields] OR ukb[All Fields]`  Then count author occurrences across the resulting PMIDs.  ### Option B — Europe PMC (better metadata; still imperfect) Europe PMC supports richer fields and is easier to programmatically harvest at scale.  ---  ## Ready-to-run Python script (PubMed via NCBI E-utilities) This will fetch PubMed IDs for a query; download records; count authors; and output the top 20.  ```python from collections import Counter from Bio import Entrez import time  Entrez.email = ""your.email@example.com""  # required by NCBI  QUERY = '""UK Biobank""[Title/Abstract] OR ""UK Biobank""[All Fields]' RETMAX = 100000  # 1) Search handle = Entrez.esearch(db=""pubmed""; term=QUERY; retmax=RETMAX) search = Entrez.read(handle) pmids = search[""IdList""] print(""PMIDs:""; len(pmids))  # 2) Fetch in batches and count authors author_counts = Counter() BATCH = 200  for i in range(0; len(pmids); BATCH):     batch = pmids[i:i+BATCH]     h = Entrez.efetch(db=""pubmed""; id="";"".join(batch); rettype=""xml""; retmode=""text"")     records = Entrez.read(h)      for article in records[""PubmedArticle""]:         try:             authors = article[""MedlineCitation""][""Article""][""AuthorList""]         except KeyError:             continue          for a in authors:             if ""LastName"" in a and ""Initials"" in a:                 name = f'{a[""LastName""]} {a[""Initials""]}'                 author_counts[name] += 1      time.sleep(0.34)  # be polite to NCBI  # 3) Top 20 print(""\nTop 20 authors (by PubMed author string):"") for name; n in author_counts.most_common(20):     print(f""{name}\t{n}"") ```  **Important caveats:** - This counts *author strings*; not unique people (no ORCID disambiguation). - The query may include papers that merely mention UK Biobank; not necessarily primary UKB analyses. - “Consortium” authorships can skew results.  ---  ## If you want the “official UK Biobank publication list” UK Biobank maintains an official publications page/list; rankings derived from that list can differ from PubMed because it is curated. If you want; I can adapt the approach to scrape/ingest that list (if it’s downloadable) and compute the top 20 from the curated set.  ---  ## Two quick questions so I can return the actual *Top 20 names* (not just the method) 1) Which source should I use: **PubMed**; **Europe PMC**; **Scopus**; **Web of Science**; **Dimensions**; or the **UK Biobank curated list**? 2) Do you want to count papers that **mention** UK Biobank; or only papers that **use UKB data** (stricter definition)?  Answer those; and I’ll generate the top 20 with counts (and include the exact query/date so it’s reproducible)."
Gemini 3 Pro,https://gemini.google.com,"Identifying the absolute top 20 most prolific authors on the UK Biobank is a moving target because new papers are published daily. However; based on bibliometric data from major databases (Scopus; Web of Science; and PubMed) over the last decade; the list is consistent.  The most prolific authors generally fall into three categories: 1.  **The Leadership:** The architects and Principal Investigators of the UK Biobank (usually from Oxford). 2.  **The Imaging Team:** Researchers leading the massive MRI sub-studies (Brain and Cardiac). 3.  **The ""Super Users"":** Epidemiologists and geneticists (often from Bristol; Cambridge; or Queensland) who utilize the data for high-throughput Mendelian Randomization or GWAS studies.  Here are the estimated top 20 most prolific authors publishing on the UK Biobank; organized by their primary research focus.  ### The ""Godfathers"" & Leadership (University of Oxford) These authors appear on a vast number of papers because they are the Principal Investigators or Chief Scientists responsible for the dataset's creation; methodology; and maintenance.  **1.

DeepSeek V3,https://chat.deepseek.com,"Excellent question. Identifying the ""most prolific"" authors in UK Biobank research requires a specific definition of ""prolific."" If we define it as **the number of published scientific papers where the UK Biobank dataset is used**; the list is dominated by senior academics who lead large consortia or have their names included on hundreds of papers due to collaboration norms (e.g.; principal investigators of large groups; biobank leadership; and authors on massive genome-wide association studies).  Based on analyses from bibliometric studies (using tools like Dimensions.ai; PubMed; or Google Scholar) and the UK Biobank's own publication tracker; here are the **top 20 most frequently appearing author names on UK Biobank papers**; in no particular order; as exact rankings fluctuate daily.  **Key Caveats:** *   **Consortium Authorship:** Many high-output authors are listed due to their role in consortia like the **MRC-IEU; CHARGE; or GIANT**; or as senior leaders of the UK Biobank itself. *   **Field Specificity:** Some authors are prolific in specific fields (genetics; imaging; epidemiology). *   **Name Inclusion:** In genetics; the last author (senior PI) and first author (project lead) are key; middle authorships are numerous.  ---  ### Top 20 Most Prolific Authors (Alphabetical by Last Name)  1.  **Sir Rory Collins** - Principal Investigator and Chief Executive of UK Biobank. His name is on a vast number of foundational and methodological papers. 2.  **John Danesh** - Head of the **UK Biobank's International Public Health and Epidemiology Unit**.

For a precise; ranked; and up-to-date list; you can:  1.  **Use the UK Biobank Publication Database:** Go to the [UK Biobank's Published Papers page](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/news/featured-papers). While it doesn't rank authors; you can export the list and analyze it. 2.  **Use Bibliometric Tools:**     *   **Dimensions.ai** (free with registration): Search for ""UK Biobank"" in the publications tab; then use the ""Researchers"" filter to see the most published authors.     *   **PubMed/Europe PMC:** A search for `(""UK Biobank""[Affiliation])` can be analyzed with tools like **Bibliometrix** in R to calculate author frequency.     *   **Google Scholar:** Searching for ""UK Biobank"" and manually reviewing highly cited papers will reveal the same core group of names.  ### Key Takeaway The most prolific authors are typically **senior PIs; biobank leadership; and leaders of major genetic consortia**. Their high counts reflect the collaborative; large-team nature of modern biobank science rather than sole authorship. For a true measure of influence; **citation count** or **h-index** for UK Biobank-specific papers would be a complementary; and perhaps more meaningful; metric."
