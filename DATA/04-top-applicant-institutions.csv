However; I can share that historically; applications to UK Biobank have come primarily from:  **Types of leading institutions typically include:** - Major UK universities with strong medical/epidemiological research programs - International research universities - Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies - Government research institutions  **Some institutions known for significant UK Biobank research include:** - University of Oxford - University of Cambridge - Imperial College London - King's College London - University College London - University of Edinburgh - Various US universities (Harvard; Yale; etc.) - International pharmaceutical companies  **To find current data; I'd recommend:** 1. Checking UK Biobank's official website and annual reports 2. Reviewing their published research impact assessments 3. Contacting UK Biobank directly for the most up-to-date statistics 4. Looking at their researcher showcase or collaboration pages  The landscape of applications likely changes over time as new research priorities emerge and more institutions globally become aware of this valuable resource."
GPT-5.2,https://chatgpt.com,"I can’t answer that reliably from UK Biobank’s public materials alone; because UK Biobank does not (to my knowledge) publish an up-to-date; official ranked “top institutions by number of applications” table that can be cited as authoritative. Without access to UK Biobank’s internal application database (or a specific public dataset/report you want me to use); any “top 10” list I generate would be guesswork or based on incomplete third‑party sources.  If you want; I can still get you a correct answer in one of these ways—tell me which you prefer:  1) **Use UK Biobank’s public Access/Researcher directory** (if it exposes application/project counts per institution at the time of query) and I’ll compile the top 10 from that.   2) **Use a specific UK Biobank annual report / transparency report** you provide (PDF/link); and I’ll extract the top 10 institutions if it’s in there.   3) **You provide an export/list of applications with institution names** (CSV/Excel/table); and I’ll compute and return the top 10 with counts.  To proceed; please share either: - a link to the page/report you want used; **or** - a CSV/table of applications including an “institution” field; **or** - confirm you want me to scrape/aggregate from the public directory (and tell me the timeframe; e.g.; “all time” vs “last 12 months”)."
Gemini 3 Pro,https://gemini.google.com,"Based on the most recent accessible data from the UK Biobank’s approved research analysis (typically updated through late 2023/early 2024); the top institutions are a mix of prestigious UK universities; top-tier US medical research centers; and increasingly; major Chinese universities.  It is important to note that the rankings can fluctuate slightly depending on whether you count affiliated hospitals (e.g.; Harvard Medical School vs. Massachusetts General Hospital) separately or together.  Here are the **top 10 leading institutions** in terms of the number of approved applications to the UK Biobank:  ### 1. Massachusetts General Hospital (USA) MGH; the original and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School; is consistently the top applicant globally. Their researchers utilize the database heavily for genetic epidemiology and identifying markers for disease.  ### 2. University of Oxford (UK) As a founding academic partner of the UK Biobank (along with the support of the NHS); Oxford remains the primary UK hub for Biobank research. They use the data across almost every medical discipline.  ### 3. University College London (UCL) (UK) UCL is a massive user of the resource; particularly in the fields of neurology; psychology; and public health.  ### 4.
