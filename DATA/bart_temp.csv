A higher consumption of cereals was significantly associated with lower risks of diabetes and diabetic complications. Polygenic of HbA1c mediates the effect of cereALS on incident diabetes.
Data came from 79,294 participants in the UK Biobank who completed at least two 24-h dietary assessments. Blood metabolites, which are readily accessible, may become highly promising biomarkers for brain disorders.
The emergence of biobank-level datasets offers new opportunities to discover novel biomarkers and develop predictive algorithms for human disease. Exome-wide sequencing and association analysis (ExWAS) in 75 K Pakistanis identified NM_000435.3(NOTCH3):c.3691 C > T.
A balanced diet and adequate physical activity (PA) are recognized as pivotal components among modifiable environmental factors. Long-term PM1 exposure can contribute to rapid cognitive decline at concentrations exceeding 23 and 5.5 &#956;g/m-3.
Study examined impact of ultra-processed food on type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, and cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) Participants with high UPF consumption had a higher risk of T2D, CVD, and CMM.
UK Biobank study in a cohort of participants who wore accelerometers for one week. Meeting physical activity guidelines is necessary to reduce all-cause mortality in those at the lower and middle thirds of handgrip strength.
Study examined the association of consumption of coffee, including different types (instant and ground) and with new-onset hypertension. The human sex ratio (fraction of males) at birth is close to 0.5 at the population level.
The impact of tobacco smoking on the whole-brain functional connectome remains largely unexplored. Fish consumption and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake were inversely associated with risk of hearing loss.
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) &#949;4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) Visceral obesity was associated with a smaller LV EDV and subclinical lower LV systolic function in men.
Cannabis use disorder has a strong genetic component and is associated with negative outcomes. High plasma vitamin C levels are associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk, but whether this association is causal is uncertain. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was highest among participants of Asian ancestry.
A study followed 245,072 participants from the UK Biobank from baseline (2006-2010) until March 30, 2023. High soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels are associated with adverse outcomes in chronic heart failure (HF) There are limited data on impact of feedback of incidental findings (IFs) from research imaging.
A study sought to construct a genomic risk score for coronary artery disease. The effect of socioeconomic deprivation on these extended lifestyle risks remains unclear. Genetic variants associated with lower activity of a gene can act as proxies to identify potential side effects.
People with low or no red meat intake generally had lower hemoglobin concentrations. Circulating protein biomarkers with causal genetic evidence represent promising drug targets. No systematic screen of the proteome has been performed."
